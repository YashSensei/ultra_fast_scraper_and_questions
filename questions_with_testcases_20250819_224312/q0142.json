  "text": "Every student of a college has to write 3 internal assessments and 1 final exam on each semester for all the 6 subjects. Each internal assessment mark is out of 20 and the final exam mark is out of 100. The best two of three assessment marks is chosen and those marks are considered to be out of 45. The final exam mark is considered to be out of 50. The remaining 5 marks is allotted based on the percentage of attendance of the student.Attendance mark allotmentBelow 51% attendance – 5 marksBelow 61% attendance – 4 marksBelow 71% attendance – 3 marksBelow 81% attendance – 2 marksBelow 91% attendance – 1 markelse – No mark for those sincere studentsSome students even bunk the assessments. If he bunks then instead of the mark ‘ab’ symbol is used which denotes “absent”. But no one bunks the final exam.No attendance is taken during exam daysFor each subject there’ll be some credit allotted by the department based on the importance of the subject.Total marks in a particular subject = best two out of three assessments (45%) + attendance mark (5%) + Final exam (50%)Points out of 10:%Total mark in a subject     Points\r\n       >= 91                   10\r\n       >= 81                    9\r\n       >= 71                    8\r\n       >= 61                    7\r\n       >  50                    6\r\n       == 50                    5\r\n       <  50                    0If the student scores 0 point in any of the subjects then he’s declared as FAILED else he’s declared as PASSED.Mr. Chintumani, a professor of Computer Science department of the college designed a software program to calculate the GRADEPOINTAVERAGE (GPA) of the student and to determine whether the student is “PASSED” or “FAILED\"GPA = sum of (credit * points) for all the subjects / total number of credits of all the subjectsInputThe first line consists of an integer n, the number of students in the class. Then n test cases follows, in each test case the first line consists of 6 integers a, b, c, d, e and f, the credits of the 6 subjects. Then for the next 6 lines, each line (each subject) consists of 5 numbers (the first three numbers are the assessment marks out of 20, the fourth is the final exam mark and the fifth is the percentage of attendance).OutputAssume you are Prof. Chintumani and print the result and GPA (rounded to two decimal places) per line for each student in the format as given in the example output.Example:Input:1\r\n1 1 1 2 2 3\r\n19 18 20 70 70\r\n17.33 15 16.66 66 70.66\r\nab ab ab 0 100\r\nab ab 10 78 78\r\n17 18.33 19.5 64 87\r\n14 8 ab 60 45Output:FAILED, 6.30Explanation of the test case:There is only 1 studentIn the Subject 0, he got 19, 18 and 20 as internal marks, considering best two of three his internals score is 43.875/45.His final exam score is 35/50.His attendance mark is 3.So the total marks he got in that subject is 81.875 which leads to 9 points.Similarly he gets.Subject 1: 74.2387 → 8 pointsSubject 2: 0 → 0 pointsSubject 3: 52.25 → 6 pointsSubject 4: 75.5588 → 8 pointsSubject 5: 59.75 → 6 pointsGPA = (9*1 + 8*1 + 0*1 + 6*2 + 8*2 + 6*3 ) / (1+1+1+2+2+3) = 6.30Since he got 0 points in at least one of the subjects he has FAILEDThe output format is “RESULT,gpa” without double quotes.",
