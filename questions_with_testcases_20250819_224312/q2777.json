  "text": "My birthday is coming up. Alas, I am getting old and would     like to feel young again. Fortunately, I have come up with an     excellent way of feeling younger: if I write my age as a number     in an appropriately chosen base      $b$, then it appears to be smaller.     For instance, suppose my age in base      $10$ is      $32$. Written in base      $16$ it is only      $20$!However, I cannot choose an arbitrary base when doing this.     If my age written in base      $b$ contains digits other than     $0$ to      $9$, then it will be obvious that I am     cheating, which defeats the purpose. In addition, if my age     written in base $b$ is too     small then it would again be obvious that I am cheating.Given my age $y$ and a     lower bound $\\ell $ on how     small I want my age to appear, find the largest base     $b$ such that      $y$ written in base      $b$ contains only decimal digits, and     is at least $\\ell $ when     interpreted as a number in base      $10$.InputMultiple test cases. Please process until EOF is reached. Each test case  consists of a single line containing two base 10     integers $y$ (     $10 \\le y \\le 10^{18}$ â€“ yes, I amveryold) and $\\ell     $ ($10 \\le \\ell \\le     y$).OutputFor each test case, display the largest base      $b$ as described above in a single line.ExampleInput:32 20\r\n2016 100Output:16\r\n42",
