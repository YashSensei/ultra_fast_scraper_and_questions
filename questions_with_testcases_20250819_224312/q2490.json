  "text": "Lucifer is the only human who has defeated RA-ONE in a computer game ...RA-One is after lucifer for revenge and G-One is there to protect him ...All thi G-One and Ra-one Nonsense has disturbed Lucifer's life ...He wants to get Rid of Ra-One and kill him . He found that Ra-One can be killed only by throwing Lucifer number of weapons at him.Lucifer number shares the some properties ofRa-One Numbersnumbers andG-One NumbersAny number is LUCIFER NUMBER if the difference between sum of digits at even location and sum of digits at odd location is prime number. For example, 20314210 is a Lucifer number:digits at odd location 0, 2, 1, 0.digits at even location 1, 4, 3, 2.difference = (1+4+3+2)-(0+2+1+0) = 10-3 = 7 ... a prime number.Lucifer has access to a Warehouse which has lots of weapons. He wants to know in how many ways can he kill him.Can you help him?InputFirst line will have a number 't' denoting the number of test cases.each of the following t lines will have 2 numbers 'a', 'b'OutputPrint single number per test case, depicting the count of Lucifer numbers in the range a, b inclusive.ExampleInput:5200 250150 200100 15050 1000 50Output:2163186NOTE:t will be less than 100. 'a' and 'b' will be between 0 and 10^9 inclusive.",
