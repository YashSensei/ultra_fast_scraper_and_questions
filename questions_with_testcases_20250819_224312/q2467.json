  "text": "Any square grid can be viewed as one or more rings, one inside the other. For example, as shown in ﬁgure (a), a 5 × 5 grid is made of three rings, numbered 1, 2 and 3 (from outside to inside.) A square grid of size N is said to be sorted, if it includes the values from 1 to N2in a row-major order, as shown in ﬁgure (b) for N = 4. We would like to determine if a given square grid can be sorted by only rotating its rings. For example, the grid in ﬁgure (c) can be sorted by rotating the ﬁrst ring two places counter-clockwise, and rotating the second ring one place in the clockwise direction.InputYour program will be tested on one or more test cases. The ﬁrst input line of a test case is an integer N which is the size of the grid. N input lines will follow, each line made of N integer values specifying the values in the grid in a row-major order. Note than 0The end of the test cases is identiﬁed with a dummy test case with N = 0.OutputFor each test case, output the result on a single line using the following format:k. resultWhere k is the test case number (starting at 1,) and result is \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the double quotes.) and single space between \".\" and \"result\".SampleInput:4\r\n9 5 1 2\r\n13 7 11 3\r\n14 6 10 4\r\n15 16 12 8\r\n3\r\n1 2 3\r\n5 6 7\r\n8 9 4\r\n0Output:1.
