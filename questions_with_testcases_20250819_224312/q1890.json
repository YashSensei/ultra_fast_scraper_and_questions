  "text": "Imagine you are a Human Being ..So you have some parameters , and those paramters contain values.If you can imagine this,you can understand the Fact that Humans Store Their ParametersIn A Big Array ... (Actually The Array Is Of Size 00963999206048 bit)[We will not discuss the meaning of the parameters here]If You want to know what is the value of some parameteryou should go throw your mind .. surfing the internal array until reach the place for the parameter.The Most Important Thing To Know .. is WHERE ARE YOU NOW !And If We Suppose That Your parameters will not change until you consider to do this(Actually Thats Happend By surfing the internal array until reach the parameter PlaceAnd Then Change ItAndThe Most Important Thing To Know Here..Is What Is The value stored Before Change(But Why?Because Humans Can Only Change Their Parameters By Increasing/Decreasing Its values(You Should Know That Humans Born (you don't have to know how or why) with initial value of ZEROFor Every Place in their internal array)))The only way to know where are you (In theInternal Array)and what Is the Value there IS to follow you from Bornto the point you are in now (you know humans lives on Average 00963113324820 ms on their planet Earth (The Average Brain Life)and it's a little bit hard to follow them from the millisecond Zero To The millisecond 00963113324819 )...Let's Talk A little About Humans LifesIt's Not So Complicated,As TheyAlways move on,(actually they can't stop the time until now :D Or even Go Back)..they have an Internal Stack To Save A Check Points In their LIFE..TheseCheck Pointsare the moments they call (Taking Decisions)These Points Make two Branches In Humans Lifes (One Branch is to go on andcomplete their life,executing every thing they supposed to do until reach theMemoryTime,Thats Also Make Two Branches one Is to Skip Memory Time And Go OnAnd The Other is (the Only Time They Go Back) theypop the last check pointin their internal stack and go back to it,repeating every thing they've done from that moment)(Second Branch IS That They DO NOTHING UNTIL they reach the memory time(discussed before)and as they have No Memories They Skip The Memory time(never go back) and go on forward)To Simulate Humans Life We Can write Mosty's Code.What is Mosty's code?Denote The Only 11 Actions Humans Do As Follow:BORNdenotes Born ...(where human starts his life with empty stack and zero_value Places in intenral array of parameters)DIEdenotes Die  ...(where human End his life and rise/fall to paradise/Hell respectively ...(actually it's a temporary pleasure/pain until the Judge Day Which We Will Not Discuss Here(Which after it comes the endless pleasure/pain depends of what he done during his Short Life))ENTERdenotes Enter His Internal Array(Note: Humans Never Die When They Are in Their Internal Array (until they goes out)Except in One situation will be Discussed later.)EXITdenotes Exit His Internal Array(Note : ignore any actions out of The Internal Array)(Note : when We Enter The Intenal array for the first time,So we are in place zeroElse we stay in the last place we were in)DEEPdenotes moving Deeper In Mind (internal array)(Note: if we were in the Deepest Place In mind then,we went deeper,we reach the zero place(as a modular Mind))FLOATdenotes moving Up Through the Mind (internal Array)(Note: if we were in Place Zero,Then We Floated Up We reach The Deepest place in mind)INCREASEdenotes increase the value stored in place(that we are in now) by one.DECREASEdenotes decrease the Value Stored in place(that we are in now) by oneCHECKPOINTdenotes moments of(Take A Decision) (described before)MEMORYdenoted Memory time when you human decide to go back or continue your life.(Note: humans take a decision of executing their LifeCode includedAfter The CHECKPOINT AND before its associated MEMORYIF and Only IF The Value He had in the last visited place in his mind was not ZEROElse he will skip his LifeCode Included in that partition until he skips the associated Memory)There is another 2 Actions(about interacting each other)We Will Not Discuss here.Following One Human At Time You Are Going To Write A Program which Printthe values Of all Visited Places In His Mind (ONLY VISITED(ONLY))using this formPlaceNumber --> ItsValueWhen to print ?As you know values changes over his life ... so we will Define The Action '*****'Which Denotes To The Moment Of 'Self Evaluation'The Input Is a part of One Human LifeBut You Can Suppose these things :1-The Human already Born , and he is old enough to enter his MIND .2-he has already entered his mind(internal array).3-He Has an initial values in his mind (you will get them in input).4-he has initial place (also you will get it).5-The Human Will Not Exit His Internal Array During The Analyziz.6-The LifeCode (in this version)Contains only The Following Actions:[DEEP,FLOAT,INCREASE,DECREASE,CHECKPOINT,MEMORY,*****]7-*****.Input Form:First Line gives M P A S (separated by spaces)M: The Number Ofalready visited places(so you will get their values in the second line)...[0<M<50].P: TheLast Placethis Human Were In his mind...[0<=P<M].A: TheNumber Of ActionsYou Will Analyze...[0<A<1000].S: TheNumber Of 'Self Evaluation'action will appeare ...[0<=S<100].[Note : for every 'Self Evaluation' actionyou should print the value of all visited places(as discussed later)]Second Line Initiate The Values Of The First M value(from 0 to M-1) of internal array.Then Comes TheAaction Of this Human,7 in each line except the last one contain less.TheValuesV[0] V[1] ... V[M-1] are32 bit integers(so that 0-1=-1 and 2147483647+1=-2147483648)[note that A includes S].Outputform:for Every 'Self Evaluation' action you should print the values in places of internal arrayusing this formPlaceNumber --> ItsValueYou ShouldPrint a jasmine flower before PlaceNumberwhen PlaceNumber == The Last Place we've visited .[what the hell is jasmine flower ?
