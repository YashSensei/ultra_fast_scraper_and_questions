  "text": "Recently Zippy received a puzzle. It is an n×m matrix. In each cell of the matrix, there is a switch and a light. Once he flips the switch in a cell, lights in the same column or the same row as the cell (including itself) change to its opposite state (which means: on → off, off → on). Zippy wants to turn on all the lights. Please help him to solve the puzzle.InputFirst line, n, m.The following n lines, each line is a m-length string, representing the original state. (0 means on and 1 means off)1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000Outputn lines, each line is a m-length string. It's obvious that if a valid solution exists, there exists a solution that every switch is flipped no more than once. So 1 means the switch is flipped once and 0 means the switch remains unflipped.It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.ExampleInput:2 3\r\n010\r\n010Output:010\r\n101",
