  "text": "Your task is to write a program that performs a simple form of run-length encoding, as described by the rules below.Any sequence of between 2 to 9 identical characters is encoded by two characters.\r\nThe first character is the length of the sequence, represented by one of the characters2through9.\r\nThe second character is the value of the repeated character.\r\nA sequence of more than 9 identical characters is dealt with by first encoding 9 characters, then the remaining ones.Any sequence of characters that does not contain consecutive repetitions of any characters is represented by a1character followed by the sequence of characters, terminated with another1.\r\nIf a1appears as part of the sequence, it is escaped with a1, thus two1characters are output.Input SpecificationThe input consists of letters (both upper- and lower-case), digits, spaces, and punctuation.\r\nEvery line is terminated with a newline character and no other characters appear in the input.Output SpecificationEach line in the input is encoded separately as described above.\r\nThe newline at the end of each line is not encoded, but is passed directly to the output.Sample InputAAAAAABCCCC\r\n12344Sample Output6A1B14C\r\n11123124",
