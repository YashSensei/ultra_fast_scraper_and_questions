  "text": "The problem is an interactive puzzle game. The puzzle given can be solved in multiple ways. You need to solve it inminimumnumber of clicks!After solving the puzzle, You'll get a score. Enter the number(score) as PLAIN TEXT as your solution.Since, there's only one way to solve the puzzle in minimum number of clicks, the score obtained for correct answer should be same.[ Edited By Min_25 ]The puzzle is as follows:RulesThe blocks represent the rooms. The lights in some of the rooms are on while others are off. You need to turn all the lights on. Clicking on a block will toggle the state. The only problem is that the other rooms which share an edge will also toggle. You need to solve the puzzle in minimum number of clicks. Print the number obtained as score as PLAIN TEXT on SPOJ.White block is on, black block is off.ScoreYour initial score is 0. If you click on (x, y), your score will be increased by x × y.The coordinates at the top-left corner and at the bottom-right corner are (1, 1) and (8, 8), respectively.InputNo problem input.OutputScore as output.",
