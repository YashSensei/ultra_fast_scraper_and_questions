  "text": "The city ofY-Ois a network of two-way streets and junctions with the following properties:There is no more than one street between each pair of junctions.Every junction is connected to every other junction either directly via a street or through other junctions by a unique path.When a light is placed at a junction, all the streets meeting at this junction are also lit.A valid lighting is a set of  junctions such that if lights were placed at these, all the streets would be lit.\r\nAn optimal lighting is a valid lighting such that it contains the least number of junctions.The task is divided into two subtasks:Find the number of lights in an optimal lighting.Find the total number of such optimal lightings in the city.InputThe first line of the input contains a positive integert <= 20, denoting the number of test cases.The description of the test cases follows one after the other.Network Description:The first line of description of a network consists of a positive integern <= 100010denoting the number of junctions in the network.Each junction is numbered with a unique integer between1andn.The followingn-1lines contain a pair of integersu v (1 <= u,v  <=  n)separated by a single space denoting that there is a street between junctionuand junctionv.OutputThe output must consist oftlines, thekthline corresponding to thekthnetwork;(1 <= k <= t).\r\nThekthline must contain two integers separated by a single space.\r\nThe first integer on thekthline must be the number of junctions in an optimal lighting of networkk.\r\nThe second integer must beN%10007, which is the remainder left by the number of optimal lightings when divided by10007.ExampleInput:241 22 33 431 21 3Output:2 31 1",
