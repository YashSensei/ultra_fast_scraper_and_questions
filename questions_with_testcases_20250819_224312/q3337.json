  "text": "A string is called a palindrome if it's the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For example,\"abdba\"is a palindrome, but\"abbaa\"is not.Given a string, print the length of the longest consecutive sequence of characters occurring at least once in this string, which is a palindrome.InputLine 1: a string consists of at most 100000 characters. The ASCII code of all characters are between 32 and 127, inclusive.Line 2: a magical key(for security purpose).OutputLine 1: the length of the longest palindrome.Line 2: the magical key.ExampleInput:abaabbabaaba\r\nMAGICAL KEYOutput:6\r\nMAGICAL KEYRestrictionOnly C++ is allowed in this problem now.In addition, you will receive\"wrong answer\"if your program don't start withthis.You can't use macro\"#undef\"in your solution as well.If you want to solve this problem in another language, send me the header file in your language please.warning:Don't try to access the memory of tester, or I will reject your solution manually, and you will lose the chance to enjoy this problem as well.Hinthint of using tester library:you can't read anything from stdin, and you can't print anything as well, your program will be terminated if you called answer().hint of viewing feedback:You can click on\"wrong answer\"link to view the feedback of judge: whether your solution didn't include the testlib, or failed on sample. (if neither, your solution failed on a further test case)Noticeupdate on Oct.24: I had updated the header file for C++, now you will receive\"Runtime Error(NZEC)\"if your solution called isSame() illegally. The submissions with old version of header file are still acceptable.rejudge on Oct.24:some test cases were added, three submissions were rejudged as TLE instead of AC.",
