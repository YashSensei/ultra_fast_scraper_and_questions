  "text": "Given the value of N, you will have to find the value of G. The meaning of G is given in the following codeG = 0;\r\nfor (i = 1; i < N; i++)\r\n  for (j = i+1; j <= N; j++) \r\n    G += gcd(i, j);Here gcd() is a function that finds the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.InputThe input file contains at most 20000 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (1 < N < 1000001). The meaning of N is given in the problem statement. Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.OutputFor each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value of G for the corresponding N. The value of G will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.ExampleInput:10\r\n100\r\n200000\r\n0Output:67\r\n13015\r\n143295493160Time limit has been changed. Some AC solutions get TLE.",
