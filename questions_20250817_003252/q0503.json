  "text": "Crossbits are like Crosswords; instead of entering words you enter binary bits 01  in a Crossbit under certain given conditions, assuming that a solution exists. An empty Crossbit of size N  is an empty grid of size NÃ—N.Given a natural number N , consider entering N2binary bits in an empty Crossbit, satisfying the following conditions:Each square in the grid contains either a 0-bit or a 1-bit with no 1-bit in two major diagonals.The total number of 1-bit in each row / column is exactly equal to K , K being a given natural number less than N.A 0-bit has at least another adjacent 0-bit either in the same row or in the same column.The Crossbit represents the N2 -bit binary number B formed by placing bits in the 1st , the 2nd , ... the Nth row from left to right.You are required to write a program that enters bits in an empty Crossbit so that the Crossbit represents the least binary number B for given N and K .As an illustration consider the case with N = 4 and K = 1 . The Crossbit shown below represents the least binary number B = 0010100000010100 of 16 bits satisfying the specified conditions.0 \t0 \t1 \t0\r\n1 \t0 \t0 \t0\r\n0 \t0 \t0 \t1\r\n0 \t1 \t0 \t0InputThe input may contain multiple test cases.For each test case parameters N and K of the Crossbit are given in one line. Assume that N does not exceed 10.The input terminates with a line containing 0 as input.OutputFor each test case, print the Crossbit in N rows; each row contains N bits with a space between two neighbouring bits. Keep a blank line after the last output line of each test case.ExampleSample Input4 1\r\n6 2\r\n0Sample Output0 0 1 0 \r\n1 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 1 \r\n0 1 0 0 \r\n\r\n0 0 0 1 1 0 \r\n1 0 0 1 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 1 1 \r\n1 1 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 1 0 0 1 \r\n0 1 1 0 0 0",
