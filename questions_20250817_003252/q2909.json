When the troupe came to Vijayanagara to perform in front of the king, Ramakrishna's performance caught the eye of the King Krishnadevaraya and other people. He shared his life story with Krishnadevaraya, who granted him the post of the comic poet in the court. Ramakrishna attained fame as a great jester poet.

One of the minister decided to insult Tenali in front of the king.The minister then took a bag containingNnumber of gems numbered from0 to N-1.He picked someKof the gems and asked the soldiers to distribute it to the people. The minister computed the sum of the numbers on the gems he distributed. He told Tenali only that thesumwas divisible byNand asked Tenali to find the number of possible sets of distributed gems.Help Tenali to find the answer. Since the result may be big return the answer modulo 1,000,000,007.InputFirst line T the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 10)Followed by T lines containing the value for N, K.N the number Gems in the bag (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000).K the number of Gems distributed (1 ≤ K ≤ Min(N, 1000)).OutputReturn the number of possible set of gems distributed modulo 1,000,000,007ExampleInput:1\r\n7 4Output:5Explanation:7 gems are numbered 0 to 6 and 4 of them were distributed. Possible sets of gems distributed are {0, 1, 2, 4}, {0, 3, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 5, 6}, {1, 3, 4, 6}, {2, 3, 4, 5}.",
