Unfortunately Gopi has a meeting with another girlfriend and asks his best friend Jai to help him. Jai with an idea of increasing his girlfriend count accepts immediately. Jai on hearing the task finds it so simple and so asks his junior to complete the task which is you.You are given a room of lengthLand breadthBwhich is divided into unit cells. In each unit cell there are some gems which amount to a certain value which can be positive, negative or even zero. You are asked to answerTqueries. Each query consists of a numberNand you need to collect gems fromNunit cells such that the value ofNunit cells when summed up must be maximum. The selection ofNunit cells in a room of length L and breadth B must be in such a way that it must be a small room of length say somexand breadth someyprovidedx × y = N. If no such value for x and y exist then print -1.InputFirst line of input contains two space separated integers L and B which denotes the length and breadth of the room.Following L lines contains B elements in each line each element specifying the value of the gems.Next line contains T which is the number of queries.Following T lines contains T elements where each element is the number N.1 ≤ L, B ≤ 1000All the L × B elements (x) will be in the range-100 ≤ x ≤ 1001 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ N ≤ 10000OutputPrint the maximum value that can be obtained for each value of N.ExampleInput:3 4\r\n1 -2 3 -4\r\n-5 6 -7 8\r\n9 -10 11 -12\r\n3\r\n1\r\n5\r\n6Output:11\r\n-1\r\n4",
