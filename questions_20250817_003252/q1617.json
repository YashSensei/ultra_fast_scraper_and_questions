  "text": "Given two strings A and B, your are to find the lexicographically smallest string after inserting B into A.For example, string A is \"369\", and string B is \"4799\". There are 4 ways that I can insert B into A, and Iâ€™ll get 4 different results: 4799369, 3479969, 3647999, 3694799. Thus, 3479969 is the lexicographically smallest one.InputInput contains several cases. Each case has 2 strings A and B with length no longer than 100000 in 2 lines. Process the input until EOF. The strings consist of only digit 1-9.OutputFor each case, output the minimal possible result.ExampleInput:369479966612345Output:347996912345666",
