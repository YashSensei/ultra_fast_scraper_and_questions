  "text": "nblocks are put in a line. You havek(1 ≤k≤ 15) kinds of dope, thei-th dope is enough to paint ci(1 ≤ ci≤ 6) blocks. You may assume the sum of all the ciequals ton. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to paint the blocks with these kinds of dope, such that no two adjacent blocks are painted with the same kind of dope.InputInput consists of multiple test cases, the number of them (≤ 2000) is given in the very first line. For each test case, the first line contains an integerk, the second line containskintegers, c1, c2... ck.OutputFor each test case, output one line with an integer, the number of ways modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n3\r\n1 2 3\r\n5\r\n2 2 2 2 2\r\n10\r\n1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5Output:10\r\n39480\r\n85937576",
