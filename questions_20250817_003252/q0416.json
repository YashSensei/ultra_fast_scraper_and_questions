  "text": "Problem Statement is easy, for a given numberN, you have to print thebase Bsuch that if we writeNin baseBthen it would contain most 0's at the end.If more then one suchbaseexist, which satisfy the given condition then print the smallest such base.InputThe first line of the input consist of a single integer numbertwhich determines the number of tests.In each of nexttlines there is a single integer numberN.Constraints0 < t ≤ 1052 ≤ N ≤ 1012OutputOutput contains one line with one integerBsuch thatNwritten in baseBhas the most zeros at the end and is the smallestBwith this property.ExampleInput:2\r\n72\r\n18Output:2\r\n3ExplanationThe answer for N=72 is B=2, because 72=10010002(72 written in base 2) has 3 zeros at the end.Using base 3, we only get 2 zeroes at the end (because 72=22003),using base 6 would also give us 2 zeros, and no other base would give us more than 1 zeroFor 18, 18=100102and 18=2003so answer will be 3.Note:Test case were regenerated on 23 June 2020.As rejudge is disabled by SPOJ please submit your code again.",
