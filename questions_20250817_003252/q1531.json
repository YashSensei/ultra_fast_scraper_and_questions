  "text": "Today we continue examine topology of the ancient country GRAPH. It was said that any four cities form atetrahedron(or 4-vertexclique) if from every city of the tetrahedron there is a road to another tetrahedron city. In the picture below is an example of tetrahedron.Theoretical note: all test cases areErdős–Rényiconnected low density graphs.Your task is to find the number of tetrahedrons in the country.InputThe first line of input will contain one integer number4 ≤ N ≤ 900, number of cities in GRAPH. FollowNlines. Each line represents cities (direct neighbors) connected to the city numberi(cities numbering is zero based) by one road.OutputPrint number of tetrahedrons in the GRAPH.ExampleInput:4\r\n1 2 3\r\n0 2 3\r\n0 1 3\r\n0 1 2Output:1",
