  "text": "A number of cities are connected by a network of highways. Each highway is bidirectional and\r\nconnects two cities, with a given travel time. What is the shortest time to get from a given city to\r\nanother given city?InputThe first line of input contains the number of test cases.Each test case starts with a line containing the number of cities n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000), the number\r\nof highways m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100000), the starting city and the ending city. Cities are numbered from\r\n1 to n.Then m lines follow, each describing one highway. The description consists of the two distinct city\r\nnumbers and the time in minutes to travel along the highway. The time will be between 1 and\r\n1000.OutputFor each test case output a single line containing the minimum time it takes to get from the start\r\nto the destination. If no connection exists, outputNONE.ExampleInput:2\r\n4 2 1 4\r\n1 2 5\r\n3 4 5\r\n4 4 1 4\r\n1 2 5\r\n2 3 5\r\n3 4 5\r\n4 2 6Output:NONE\r\n11",
