Daniel, of course, knows your exceptional programming skills, so he asked you to write him a program which givenSwill answer Kinan's questions.Example:S= \"aaa\" (without quotes)substrings of S are \"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"aaa\". The sorted list of distinct substrings will be: \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\".InputIn the first line there is Kinan's stringS(with length no more than  90000 characters). It contains only small letters of English alphabet.  The second line contains a single integerQ(Qâ‰¤ 500), the number of questions Daniel will be asked. In the nextQlines a single integerKis given (0 <K< 231).OutputOutput consists ofQlines, thei-thcontains a string which is the answer to thei-thasked question.ExampleInput:aaa223Output:aaaaaEdited:Some input file contains garbage at the end.
