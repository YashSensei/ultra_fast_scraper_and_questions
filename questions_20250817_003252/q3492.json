  "text": "Max2214 is a game that consists of a board ofRrows andCcolumns and two kinds of blocks: Some of the blocks are 2 cells high and 2 cells wide, the others are 1 cell high and 4 cells wide.  Some of the cells of the board might be marked. The objective of the game is to place the most blocks on top of the board in a way that the blocks are aligned to the rows and columns, no pair of blocks overlap, marked cells do not contain any block, and the 1×4 blocks are placed horizontally exclusively. Also, blocks must be completely inside the board.InputThe input consists in a single test.The test case begins with 2 integersRandCin a single line: (1 ≤R≤ 52) (1 ≤C≤ 22).The nextRlines containCcharacters. Each character represents a cell. If a character is X, it means the cell is a marked cell. If the character is '.' (a dot character) it means the cell is not marked.OutputShow a single line containing the maximum quantity of blocks that can be placed in the board following the rules mentioned above.ExampleInput:4 5X....X..XXX..XX....XOutput:3",
