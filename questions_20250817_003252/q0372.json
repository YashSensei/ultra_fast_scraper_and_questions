  "text": "Let us consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two \r\nnumbers appear in the second line etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest \r\nof the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top\r\ntowards the base, so that:on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely \r\neither directly below or below and one place to the right;the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100;all numbers are positive integers between 0 and 99.Take care about your fingers, do not use more than256bytes of code.InputIn the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). \r\nThen n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.OutputFor each test case write the determined value in a separate line.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n1\r\n2 1\r\n1 2 3\r\n4 \r\n1 \r\n1 2 \r\n4 1 2\r\n2 3 1 1Output:5\r\n9Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
