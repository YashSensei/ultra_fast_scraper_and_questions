  "text": "Bessie has baked a rectangular brownie that can be thought of as\r\nan R×C grid (1 ≤ R ≤ 500; 1 ≤ C ≤ 500) of little brownie squares.\r\nThe square at row i, column j contains Nij(0 ≤ Nij≤ 4,000)\r\nchocolate chips.Bessie wants to partition the brownie up into A×B chunks (1 ≤ A\r\n≤ R; 1 ≤ B ≤ C): one for each of the A×B cows. The brownie is\r\ncut by first making A-1 horizontal cuts (always along integer\r\ncoordinates) to divide the brownie into A strips. Then cut each\r\nstrip ×independently× with B-1 vertical cuts, also on integer\r\nboundaries. The other A×B-1 cows then each choose a brownie piece,\r\nleaving the last chunk for Bessie. Being greedy, they leave Bessie\r\nthe brownie that has the least number of chocolate chips on it.Determine the maximum number of chocolate chips Bessie can receive,\r\nassuming she cuts the brownies optimally.As an example, consider a 5 row × 4 column brownie with chips\r\ndistributed like this:1 2 2 1\r\n         3 1 1 1\r\n         2 0 1 3\r\n         1 1 1 1\r\n         1 1 1 1Bessie must partition the brownie into 4 horizontal strips, each\r\nwith two pieces. Bessie can cut the brownie like this:1 2 | 2 1\r\n       ---------\r\n       3 | 1 1 1\r\n       ---------\r\n       2 0 1 | 3\r\n       ---------\r\n       1 1 | 1 1\r\n       1 1 | 1 1Thus, when the other greedy cows take their brownie piece, Bessie\r\nstill gets 3 chocolate chips.InputLine 1: Four space-separated integers: R, C, A, and B.Lines 2 to R+1: Line i+1 contains C space-separated integers: Ni,1... Ni,c.OutputA single integer giving the required answer.ExampleInput:5 4 4 2\r\n1 2 2 1\r\n3 1 1 1\r\n2 0 1 3\r\n1 1 1 1\r\n1 1 1 1Output:3Problem was added from USACO.",
