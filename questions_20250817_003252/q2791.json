Width of each river is at most105meters. To cross the river stones are kept at a distance of1meter. Mowgli can jump across at mostKstones at a time. Given total number of stonesAikept on theithriver. Your job is to tell total number of ways Mowgli can cross each river. As answer can be very large, give outputmodulo 1000000007.InputThere are around 10 test cases.First line contains an integerTnumber of test casesEach test case consists of two lines:First line contains two integersN (number of rivers)andK (maximum number of stones Mowgli can skip).Next line containsNintegers,Ai(number of stones kept on ithriver).OutputOne line for each river.Total number of ways Mowgli can cross the river.Constraints:T ≤ 101 ≤ N ≤ 1000 ≤ K ≤ 500 ≤ Ai≤ 100000ExampleInput:1\r\n2 1\r\n1 2Output:2\r\n3ExplanationFor second river with 2 stones. Mowgli can jump across 1 stone maximum at a time. So there are three choicesStart → 1st → 2nd → Destination.Start → 1st → Destination.Start → 2nd → Destination.",
