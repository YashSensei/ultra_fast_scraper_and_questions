  "text": "As another one of their crazy antics, the N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) cows want Farmer John to race against the clock to answer some of their pressing questions.The cows are lined up in a row from 1 to N, and each one is holding a sign representing a number, Ai(1 ≤ Ai≤ 1,000,000,000). The cows need FJ to perform Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 50,000) operations, which can be either of the following:Modify cow i's number to X (1 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000,000). This will be represented in the input as a line containing the letter M followed by the space-separated numbers i and X.Count how many cows in the range [P, Q] (1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ N) have Ai≤ X (0 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000,000). This will be represented in the input as a line containing the letter C followed by the space-separated numbers P, Q, and X.Of course, FJ would like your help.InputThe first line gives the integers N and Q, and the next N lines give the initial values of Ai. Finally, the next Q lines each contain a query of the form \"M i X\" or \"C P Q X\".OutputPrint the answer to each 'C' query, one per line.ExampleInput:4 6\r\n3\r\n4\r\n1\r\n7\r\nC 2 4 4\r\nM 4 1\r\nC 2 4 4\r\nC 1 4 5\r\nM 2 10\r\nC 1 3 9Output:2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n2FJ has 4 cows, whose initial numbers are 3, 4, 1, and 7. The cows then give him 6 operations; the first asks him to count the how many of the last three cows have a number at most 4, the second asks him to change the fourth cow's number to 1, etc.Warning: large input/output data.",
