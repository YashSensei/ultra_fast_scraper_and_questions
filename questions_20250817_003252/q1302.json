  "text": "Fibonacci sequence is defined as follow: F1= 1, F2= 2, Fi= Fi-1+ Fi-2(i > 2).Each natural number X can be expressed by the maximum numbers that are less than or equal to X in Fibonacci sequence: X = a1xF1+ a2xF2+ … Therefore, in Fibonacci system, X is known as: anan-1…a1. For example, 1 = 1F, 2 = 10F, etc. If we write all natural numbers successively in Fibonacci system, we will obtain a sequence like this: 1_1_0… This is called “Fibonacci bit sequence of natural numbers”.Your task is counting the numbers of times that bit 1 appears in the first N bits of this sequence.InputLine 1: An integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1015)OutputLine 1: An integer K is the resultExampleInput:2Output:2",
