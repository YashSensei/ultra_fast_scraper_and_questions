  "text": "Bahl and Debnath are always looking up for new exciting games on the internet. Yesterday, Bahl stumbled across a new game known as “Totient Game”. He immediately showed that to Debnath. They found it pretty exciting and decided to play it. The game is as follows:The game is played with N piles of stones.2 players play alternatively and at each turn a player selects a pile and divides it into two unequal sized piles “i” and “j” such that Totient(i) × Totient(j) = Totient(i × j) and i+j = number of stones in that pile.The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.Bahl insists on starting the game first. Can you predict the winner of the game?Assume that both player plays optimally.Euler's totient function.InputFirst line gives T, the number of test cases.Each test starts with a line containing “N”, the number of piles.Next line gives N space separated integers. The ithinteger represents the number of stones in the ithpile.OutputOutput T lines each containing the winner of the T games. Output “Bahl” if Bahl wins the game or “Debnath” if Debnath wins the game.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ N ≤ 1051 ≤  Number of stones in each pile  ≤ 107ExampleInput:1\r\n3\r\n1 2 3Output:Bahl",
