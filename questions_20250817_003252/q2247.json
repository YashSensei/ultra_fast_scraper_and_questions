  "text": "The 07 February 2013 was Tjandra's 19th birthday,\r\n I want to make a present to him and all other great SPOJ solvers by the way.\r\nSo I set this HARD puzzle problem extension of the yet goodTJANDRAS.Warning :To solve the 'easy' task, you need a O(N^0.5) algorithm,\r\n but to solve this 'harder' task, you need something around O(N^0.34),\r\n so it's not about optimization tricks!!!\r\n\r\nPlease note that I checked my data with my 'semi-brute-force'-O(N^0.5)-Python3-solution and it took me 16 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't forget to have fun with that problem!The GameThis game/puzzle is about matches, given N matches,\r\n your task is to arrange the matches (not necessarily all)\r\n such that the number of rectangles (any size) is maximum.InputThe input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.\r\nIn each of the next T lines there are one integer N.OutputFor each test case, on a single line, print the required answer\r\n (maximum number of rectangles).ExampleInput:6\r\n3\r\n4\r\n8\r\n12\r\n15\r\n987654321123456789Output:0\r\n1\r\n3\r\n9\r\n12\r\n60966316127114768913148159571503206Constraints1 < T ≤ 100\r\n1 < N ≤ 10^18The T numbers N are uniform-randomly chosen in the range.ExplanationsFirst test case:\r\nNo rectangle can be formed with only 3 matches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond test case:\r\nOnly one rectangle can be formed with 4 matches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThird test case:\r\nThere are max 3 rectangles.\r\n(2 size 1x1, 1 size 2x1) can be formed with number of matches ≤ 8,\r\n here is one of the matches formation:Fourth test case:\r\nThere are max 9 rectangles.\r\n(4 size 1x1, 2 size 2x1, 2 size 1x2, 1 size 2x2) can be formed with number of matches ≤ 12, here is one of the formation:Fifth test case:\r\nthere are max 12 rectangles.\r\n(5 size 1x1, 3 size 2x1, 1 size 3x1, 2 size 1x2, 1 size 2x2) can be formed with number of matches ≤ 15, here is one of the formation:Sixth test case:\r\nYou have to figure by yourself how to compute that in the required time.",
