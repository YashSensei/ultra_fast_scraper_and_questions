  "text": "Hugo Wangbros has been playing a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh recently, and he recently invented his own variation of the game:Hu-Gi-Oh!In the world ofHu-Gi-Oh, Hugo is in a duel where he must build apower chainusing a selection of magic cards. Each card has apower valueand acooldowntime. Hugo wants to play cards in a sequence such that:Heskipsat least the number of rounds equal to the cooldown after using any card before using the next one.The total power ismaximized.Given a list of cards, each with its power and cooldown, compute themaximum powerHugo can achieve.Note: Hugo is allowed to skip the card on any round.Inputn: number of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)n lines follow, each containing two integers p and c:p: power of the card (0 ≤ p ≤ 104)c: cooldown of the card (0 ≤ c ≤ n)np1c2p1c2...pncnOutputoutput a single integer, the maximum total power Hugo can achieve.ExampleInput:5\r\n3 2\r\n2 1\r\n4 0\r\n6 2\r\n1 1Output:10ExplanationThe optimal solution is to first play card 3 (p=4, c=0), and play card 4 (p=6, c=2). Which gives 10.",
