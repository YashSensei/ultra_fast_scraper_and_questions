  "text": "Jack claims that he has telekinetic powers.\r\nHe has made a bet with Mike that he would throw a die n times and would get exactly k pips in total.\r\nJack's die has 6 faces with numbers from 1 to 6 written on them and is perfectly symmetric.\r\nMike does not believe in Jack's telekinetic powers (in general, being a tenacious rationalist,\r\nhe does not believe in telekinesis), but he is concerned that Jack could win the bet\r\nsimply by luck.\r\nTherefore, he would like to know what is the chance (in percent) of such an unlucky event,\r\nand asked you to write a program that would help him solve this problem.InputThe first line of the standard input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) denoting the number of\r\ntest cases.\r\nEach of the following t lines contains a description of one test case in the form of two integers niand ki(1 ≤ ni, ki≤ 106) separated by a single space.OutputTo the standard output t lines should be written, containing the answers to respective test cases.\r\nThe answer to one test case is the probability (in percent) that Jack wins the bet, roundeddownto the nearest integer.ExampleFor the input data:1\r\n1 6the correct result is:16Task author: Jakub Onufry Wojtaszczyk.",
