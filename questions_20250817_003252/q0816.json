He has a Phone along with him and no one else to help him out. He calls you and asks for help. Chuck the story getting into the problem now, There are N x M blocks of Honey combs in the maze and you are given a starting point. your task is to help Mr. Iyer find out whether or not he can traverse the maze and return to his original position. The constraint being that a honey comb (Block) once visited cannot be visited again. Also, he has to make a minimum of 'k' number of moves before returning to the starting point. The '.' represent the empty blocks whereas the '*' represent the blocks that can't be visited. from a block (x, y) Iyer can move only to blocks (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1). Help Mr. Iyer return to his original position.InputThe first line of the input contains the dimensions of the maze (N × M).Second line of the input contains 'k' as described above.The third line denotes the coordinates of the starting point (1-n), (1-m).The next N lines contain the description of the Nth row.OutputOutput \"YES\" if it's possible.Else output \"NO\".Constraints1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100ExampleInput:5 5\r\n14\r\n1 2\r\n...**\r\n*...*\r\n*....\r\n.*...\r\n.*..*Output:YESExplanation1,2 → 2,2 → 3,2 → 3,3 → 4,3 → 5,3 → 5,4 → 4,4 → 4,5 → 3,5 → 3,4 → 2,4 → 2,3 → 1,3 → 1,214 moves were made. So, it is possible. Also, no blocks were repeated.",
