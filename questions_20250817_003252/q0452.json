  "text": "As a world-renowned computer scientist, you have received an offer from a start-up Swiss bank to write some software for ATMs. Your program has to check if it is able to withdraw the amount requested by the customer with the available banknotes.InputThe first line contains the number D, indicating the number of data sets. Each data set fits on one line and consists of six numbers: a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, k (ai ≤ 1000, k ≤ 10000). Numbers a1 - a5 denote the number of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 Swiss franc banknotes available in the ATM. The number k indicates the desired amount to be withdrawn.OutputFor each data set, one line should appear in the result containing the single word TAK (yes) or NIE (no) indicating whether the ATM can currently supply the requested amount.ExampleInput:30 2 10 10 1000 1101 2 10 10 1000 110199 100 40 20 10 10000Output:NIETAKNIE",
