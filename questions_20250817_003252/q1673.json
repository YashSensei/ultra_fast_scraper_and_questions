  "text": "A website provides its users with a variety of services. There are a total ofKservices available on that website. At present there areMusers/clients registered to the website.Now each client of this service provider firm is to be allocated a project by the website which makes use of a stringA1, A2, A3 ... AnofNservices all of which the website is providing. The order in which the services are executedmatters(compiling and then linking is different from linking and then compiling). Also, in a particular project, the same services cannot be executed twice in succession. For example, compiling → linking → compiling is allowed, but linking → linking → compiling is not allowed because 'linking' comes twice in succession.All the M clients will start working at the same time and the time taken for the execution of all services is equal. At a time, one service can be accessed by only one client as there is only one server. For eg. If there are 3 clients with projects –A1, A2 ... An;B1, B2 ... BnandC1, C2 ... Cn, thenAi,Bi,Ciare pairwise distinctfor 1 ≤i≤N. You need to find in how many ways in which theMclients can be allocated their projects.InputFirst line containingT(number of test cases).For each test case one line containing 3 integersN,MandK.OutputFor each test case output a separate line containing the answer modulo 1000000007.Constraints1 ≤T≤ 100 ≤N≤ 10000000001 ≤M≤ 1000 ≤K≤ 1000SampleInput3\r\n2 2 3\r\n1 2 3\r\n2 3 4Output18\r\n6\r\n264",
