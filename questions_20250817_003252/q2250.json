  "text": "In this problem, we try to compute discrete kthroot modulo n; given n, k, a; find all the solutions for x such that xk= a (mod n) and x is coprime with n.InputFor each input file, there are 3 space separated integers n, k, a.n = pefor some odd prime p, integer e > 0; 0 ≤ a < n ≤ 109, 0 ≤ k < phi(n), where phi is Euler's totient function; the numbers n, a are coprimes.OutputThe first line of the output contains a single integer m, the number of solutions in the range [0, n - 1] that are coprimes with n, followed by m lines that contain the m solutions in ascending order. It is guaranteed that m ≤ 104.ExampleInput:5 1 3Output:1\r\n3",
