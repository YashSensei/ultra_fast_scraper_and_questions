  "text": "In this task let's consider distance between two positive integers defined as below.Single operation is: multiplying some number by prime number or dividing some number by prime number (we can divide only when remainder is equal to 0.)Distance d between two numbers a, b is minimum number operations to convert one number to another.For example d(69, 42) = 3.This distance is very similar to well-known term \"distance\" in real human life:d(a, a) = 0, distance number to itself is 0.d(a, b) = d(b, a) distance from a→b is equal to b→a.d(a, b) + d(b, c) ≥ d(a, c) triangle equation is true too.With given n number you have to determine for each i-th of those numbers closest number ajfrom set that i ≠ j and if there is many numbers with equal, smallest distance, you have to pick number with smallest indexInputIn first line - number n ≤ 105.In next n lines - i-th number. Every number is not greater than 106.OutputYou have to output n lines.I-th line should contain index of closest number (if there are many answers, please output smallest index.)ExampleInput:6123456Output:211212",
