  "text": "Given a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 34) numbers S1, ..., SN(-20,000,000 ≤ Si≤ 20,000,000), determine how many subsets of S (including the empty one) have a sum between A and B (-500,000,000 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 500,000,000), inclusive.InputThe first line of standard input contains the three integers N, A, and B. The following N lines contain S1through SN, in order.OutputPrint a single integer to standard output representing the number of subsets satisfying the above property. Note that the answer may overflow a 32-bit integer.ExampleInput:3 -1 2\r\n1\r\n-2\r\n3Output:5The following 5 subsets have a sum between -1 and 2:0 = 0 (the empty subset)1 = 11 + (-2) = -1-2 + 3 = 11 + (-2) + 3 = 2",
