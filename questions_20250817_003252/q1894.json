The question is simple: find the set at then-th position in the sequence and print it in increasing order of its elements.Each line of input contains a numbern, which is a positive integer with no more than 19 digits. The last line of input contains 0 and it should not be processed.For each line of input, output a single line displaying then-th set as described above, in the format used in the sample output.ExampleInput:1\r\n7\r\n14\r\n783\r\n1125900981634049\r\n0Output:{ }\r\n{ 3, 9 }\r\n{ 1, 9, 27 }\r\n{ 3, 9, 27, 6561, 19683 }\r\n{ 59049, 3486784401, 205891132094649, 717897987691852588770249 }",
