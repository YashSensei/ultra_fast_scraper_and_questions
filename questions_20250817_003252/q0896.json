  "text": "On June 13th team Germany has its first match in the FIFA world cup against team  Australia. As the coach of team Germany, it is your duty to select the lineup for  the game. Given this is your first game in the cup, naturally you want to make a  good impression. Therefore you'd like to play with the strongest lineup possible.You have already decided on the tactical formation you wish to use, so now you  need to select the players who should fill each of the11positions in the team.  Your assistant has selected the11strongest players from your squad, but this still  leaves the question where to put which player.Most players have a favoured position on the field where they are strongest, but  some players are proficient in different positions. Your assistant has rated the  playing strength of each of your11players in each of the11available positions in  your formation, where a score of100means that this is an ideal position for the  player and a score of0means that the player is not suitable for that position at all.  Find the lineup which maximises the sum of the playing strengths of your players for  the positions you assigned them. All positions must be occupied, however, do not put  players in positions they are not proficient with (i.e.\\ have a score of0).InputThe input consists of several test cases. The first line of input contains the numberCof test cases. For each case you are given11lines, one for each player, where  thei-th line contains11integer numberssijbetween0and100.sijdescribes thei-th player's strength on thej-th position. No player will be proficient  in more than five different positions.OutputFor each test case output the maximum of the sum of player strengths over all possible lineups. Each test case result should go on a separate line. There will always be at least one valid lineup.ExampleInput:1\r\n100 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 80 70 70 60 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 40 90 90 40 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 40 85 85 33 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 70 60 60 85 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 95 70 60 60 0 0\r\n0 45 0 0 0 80 90 50 70 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 40 90 90 40 70 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 50 70 85 50 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 66 60 0 80 80\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 50 50 0 90 88Output:970",
