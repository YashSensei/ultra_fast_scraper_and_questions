  "text": "Having cleared the ACM ICPC online round you receive a job offer of teaching JAVA programming to High School Students of Byteland. You gladly take the job offer and after a few days of teaching you give the students a program to write. You ask them to write aFIZZBUZZprogram. They are either too smart or too lazy. They argue that it is too difficult and challenge you to do better than that without using any English letters. You consult senior programmerMitchwho suggests you a way out of the problem. \"Do it in BF,\" he says.Tjandrasuggests you do it in Whitespace.InputTwo space separated one digit integers A and B. Then a newline. Then a string C of maximum length 5 followed by a newline. Then another string D of max length 5 followed by a newline. It is guaranteed that gcd(A,B) < A and gcd(A,B) < B. Also the strings comprise only alphanumeric characters.OutputFor all numbers in the set [1, 99] print C if the number is divisible by A, print D if divisible by B, print C concat D if divisible by both and the number (with preceding zeroes if required) if it divisible by neither A nor B.ExampleInput:2 3\r\nHappy\r\n2013Output:01\r\nHappy\r\n2013\r\nHappy\r\n05\r\nHappy2013\r\n07\r\n..........and you get the ideaWishing all of you a HAPPY NEW YEAR 2013 :)Edit: 05-01-2013I am giving you all a link to mostafa_36a2's solution.
