  "text": "Apart from the Hanging Gardens the Babylonians (around 3000-539 b.c.) built the Tower of Babylon as well. The tower was meant to reach the sky, but the project failed because of a confusion of language imposed from much higher above.For the 2638th anniversary a model of the tower will be rebuilt.ndifferent types of blocks are available. Each one of them may be duplicated as many times as you like. Each type has a heighty, a widthxand a depthz. The blocks are to be stacked one upon eachother so that the resulting tower is as high as possible. Of course the blocks can be rotated as desired before stacking. However for reasons of stability a block can only be stacked upon another ifbothof its baselines are shorter.InputThe number of types of blocksnis located in the first line of each test case. On the subsequentnlines the heightyi, the widthxiand the depthziof each type of blocks are given. There are never more than 30 different types available.There are many test cases, which come one by one. Input terminates with n = 0.Edited:You can assume that max(xi,yi,zi) <= 2500.OutputFor each test case your program should output one line with the height of the highest possible tower.ExampleSample input:5\r\n31 41 59\r\n26 53 58\r\n97 93 23\r\n84 62 64\r\n33 83 27\r\n1\r\n1 1 1\r\n0Sample output:342\r\n1",
