Each coefficient of polynomial h(x) is guaranteed to be an integer.ExampleInput:5\r\n0\r\n13\r\n1\r\n-1 2\r\n1\r\n0 2\r\n2\r\n2 -5 9\r\n3\r\n23 9 21 104Output:13\r\n0 1\r\n1 1\r\n1 2 3\r\n31 41 59 26ExplanationFirst Test Casef(x) = 13g(x) that satisfy: g(x) - g(x - 1) = f(x) = 13 and g(0) = 0 is: g(x) = 13xh(x) = g(x)/x so h(x) = 13output : 13Second Test Casef(x) = -1 + 2xg(x) that satisfy: g(x) - g(x - 1) = f(x) = -1 + 2x and g(0) = 0 is: g(x) = x2h(x) = g(x) / x so h(x) = x = 0 + 1xoutput : 0 1Third Test Casef(x) = 0 + 2xg(x) that satisfy: g(x) - g(x - 1) = f(x) = 2x and g(0) = 0 is: g(x) = x + x2h(x) = g(x) / x so h(x) = 1 + 1xoutput : 1 1See also:Another problem added by Tjandra Satria Gunawan",
