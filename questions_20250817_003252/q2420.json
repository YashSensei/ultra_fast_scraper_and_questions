  "text": "\"In graph theory, an arborescence is a directed graph in which, for a vertex v called the root and any other vertex u, there is exactly one directed path from v to u. In other words, an arborescence is a directed, rooted tree in which all edges point away from the root. Every arborescence is a directed acyclic graph.\"-- from Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaYou are given a directed graph withNvertices, and your task is to count the number of different arborescences of sizeNthat can be found in the given graph.Two arborescences are considered different when they consist of different edges.InputInput consists of multiple test cases.For each test case, the first line contains one integerNdescribed as above.N lines follows, each consists ofNcharacters, either '0' or '1', representing the adjacency matrix of the graph.The directed graph contains edge (i,j) if and only if thejth character of theith line of the matrix is '1'.The graph consists of no more than 8 vertices.End of input is indicated by a line consisting of a single 0.OutputFor each test case, output one line consisting of one single integer, the number of arborescences.ExampleInput:2\r\n00\r\n00\r\n2\r\n01\r\n10\r\n0Output:0\r\n2",
