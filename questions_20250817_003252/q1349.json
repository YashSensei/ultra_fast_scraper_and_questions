  "text": "You are given a string S which consists of 250000 lowercase Latin letters at most. We define F(x) as the maximal number of times that some string with length x appears in S. For example for string 'ababa' F(3) will be 2 because there is a string 'aba' that occurs twice. Your task is to output F(i) for every i so that 1 ≤ i ≤ |S|.InputString S consists of at most 250000 lowercase Latin letters.OutputOutput |S| lines. On the i-th line output F(i).ExampleInput:ababaOutput:32211",
