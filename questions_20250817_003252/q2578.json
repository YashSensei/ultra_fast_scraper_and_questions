  "text": "A fraction tree is an infinite binary tree defined as follows:Every node of tree contains a fraction.Root of tree contains the fraction 1/1.Any node with fraction i/j has two children : left child with fractioni / (i + j)and right child with fraction(i + j) / j.For example, fraction tree up to 3 levels is as shown:We number the nodes according to increasing levels (root is at level 1) and at any same level, nodes are numbered from left to right. So first node holds the fraction 1/1, second one holds 1/2, third one holds 2/1 fourth one holds 1/3 and so on.Your task is simple. Given a number n, you are to find the fraction at the nth node.InputEvery line of the input contains a single number n. You are to find the fraction at nth node of fraction tree. Input file terminates with a 0 which is not to be processed.OutputFor each input, print numerator and denominator of the lowest form of the fraction separated by a /. Output of each case to be done in separate lines.ExampleInput:1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n7\r\n0Output:1/1\r\n1/2\r\n2/1\r\n3/1Constraints1 ≤ number of test cases ≤ 30000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1010",
