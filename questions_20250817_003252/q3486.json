The stairs will be made of W segments of wooden, she is very confident on building the stairs, but she wants to build the stairs with some separation between steps. As you know, the end of a step is overlapped by the beginning of the other, and so on, between steps there are a single separation, as Giselle is very conservative, she wants to build the stairs using at most W segments of wood.The image will help you to understand the task.As you can see in the image, there is a single separation between each step relating to the height and the width of every step.Giselle wants to build stairs using E pieces of wood that she wants to cut into at most W steps. You can only cut vertically and can't rotate the given pieces. Each step's width must be exactly M+1. M is the overlap and 1 is a constant width for placing feet.InputThe first line of the test data will start with an integer T representing the T test cases, then, T cases will follow.Each case starts with four positive integers (E, M, K, W) denoting E pieces of wood, M meters of overlap, K height of separator between each step and W, the maximum number of steps that can be cut out. Next, E lines will follow, each with two integers Eh and Ew representing respectively the height and the width of each piece of wood Giselle has.OutputYou must output the string \"Scenario #i: \" where i is the number of test case you're analyzing (starting at 1), followed by the maximum amount of height that you can possibly build.ExampleInput:3\r\n5 1 1 3\r\n6 2\r\n5 10\r\n4 20\r\n3 15\r\n1 1\r\n3 1 0 5\r\n3 15\r\n2 20\r\n1 60\r\n2 1 1 25\r\n15 10\r\n12 10Output:Scenario #1: 19\r\nScenario #2: 15\r\nScenario #3: 145Explanation of the First CaseYou can only cut the segment of width 6 into one piece, but the 5 segment of width 10 you can cut it into 5 pieces, as you only need 3 pieces to use, the maximum height will be of 6+5+5+3 = 19Constraints(1 <= Width and Height of each wooden piece <= 1000) = \"WiHi\".Small input (40%)1<= T <= 2001<= {E, K, M} <= 100WiHi <= M <= 1001<= W <=100Large Input (60%)1 <= T <= 101 <= {E, K} <= 100,000WiHi <= M <= 1,0001 <= W <= 10,000",
