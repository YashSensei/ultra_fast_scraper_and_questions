  "text": "Johnny is playing with some dominoes one afternoon. His dominoes come in a variety of heights and colors.Just like any other child, he likes to put them in a row and knock them over. He wants to know something: how many pushes does it take to knock down all the dominoes? Johnny is lazy, so he wants to minimize the number of pushes he takes. A domino, once knocked over, will knock over any domino that it touches on the way down.For the sake of simplicity, imagine the floor as a one-dimensional line, where 1 is the left-most point. Dominoes will not slip along the floor once toppled. Also, dominoes do have some width: a domino of length 1 at position 1 can knock over a domino at position 2.For the mathematically minded: A domino at positionxwith heighth, once knocked over to the right, will knock all dominoes at positionsx+1,x+2 ...x+hright-ward as well. Similarly, the same domino knocked over to the left will knock all dominoes at positionsx-1,x-2 ...x-hleft-ward.InputThe input starts with a single integerN(N≤ 100000), the number of dominoes, followed byNpairs of integers. Each pair of integers represents the location and height of a domino, in that order (0 ≤ location ≤ 109, 0 ≤ height ≤ 109). No two dominoes will have the same location.OutputA single integer on a single line: the minimum number of pushes Johnny must make in order to ensure that all dominoes are knocked over.ExampleInput:6\r\n1 1\r\n2 2\r\n3 1\r\n5 1\r\n6 1\r\n8 3Output:2Explanation|\r\n  |           |\r\n| | |   | |   |\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Pushing 1 causes 2 and 3 to fall, while pushing 8 causes 6 to fall and gently makes 5 tip over as well.",
