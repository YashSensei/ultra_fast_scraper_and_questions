  "text": "Given a natural number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1e16), please output the summation of all its proper divisors.Definition:A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.e.g. number 20 has 5 proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and the divisor summation is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = 22.InputAn integer stating the number of test cases (equal to 500), and that many lines follow, each containing one integer between 1 and 1e16 inclusive.OutputOne integer each line: the divisor summation of the integer given respectively.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n10\r\n20Output:1\r\n8\r\n22warning: a naive algorithm may not run in time.",
