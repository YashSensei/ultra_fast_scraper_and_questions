  "text": "A square free number is defined as a number which is not divisible by any square number.For example, 13, 15, 210 are square free numbers, where as 25 (divisible by 5*5), 108 (divisible by 6*6), 18 (divisible by 3*3) are not square free numbers. However number 1 is not considered to be a square and is a squarefree number.Now you must find how many numbers from number a to b, are square free and also have a digit d inside it.For example for in the range 10 to 40 te squarefree numbers having digit 3 are 13, 23, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39InputThe first line contains an integer T, which is the number of test-casesThen follow T lines, each containing 3 integers a, b and d.1 <= T <= 20,0001 <= a <= b <= 100,0000 <= d <= 9OutputPrint one integer which is the required number as described in the problem statement.ExampleInput:3\r\n10 40 3\r\n1 100 4\r\n1 100000 7Output:10\r\n9\r\n26318",
