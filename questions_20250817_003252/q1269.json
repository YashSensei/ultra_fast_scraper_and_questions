  "text": "Your task is simple. A knight is placed on the top left corner of a chessboard having2nrows and2ncolumns.\r\n\r\nIn how many ways can it move such that it ends up at a corner after at mostkmoves ?InputThe first line contains an integerT, the number of test cases.\r\nEach of the nextTlines contains 2 integers :n, k.OutputOutputTlines, one for each test case, containing the required total number of configurations.\r\n Since the answer can get very big, output it modulo 1000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 1\r\n2 2\r\n3 3Output:1\r\n5\r\n7Constraints1 <= T <= 50\r\n2 <= n <= 24\r\n1 <= k <= 10^9InformationIn the input files, there will be two cases for each possiblen.\r\nConstraints allows fast languages to get AC under 0.5s (total time for the 5 input files), with non-optimized scholar methods only.\r\nAdvanced methods can be slightly faster, and needed to get AC with interpreted languages (without any guaranty for all of them).\r\nIt is recommended to solve first the original problemTRKNIGHTin a very fast way. After that, solve this problem could remain a hard task ; it's not just a simple extension.\r\nGood luck and have fun ;-)Edit(12/II/2017, compiler update) New TL.",
