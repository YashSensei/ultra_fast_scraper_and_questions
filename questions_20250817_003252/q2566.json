  "text": "Mr. B wrote an addition equation such as 123+321=444 on the blackboard after class. Mr. G removes some of the digits and makes it look like “1?3+??1=44?”. After Mr. B realizes some digits are missing, he wants to recover them. Unfortunately, there may be more than one way to recover the equation. For example “1?3+??1=44?” can be recovered to “123+321=444” or “143+301=444” and many other possible solutions. Your job is to determine the number of different possible solutions.InputEach test case describes a single line with an equation likea+b=cwhich contains exactly one plus sign+and one equal sign=with some digits are missing and replaced with?. You may assumea,bandcare non-negative integers, and the length of each number is no more than 9. In the other words, the equation will contain three integers less than 1,000,000,000.OutputFor each test case, display a single line with its case number and the number of possible solutions to recover the equation.ExampleInput:7+1?=1?\r\n?1+?1=22Output:Case 1: 3\r\nCase 2: 1ExplanationThere are three solutions for the first case:7+10=17, 7+11=18, 7+12=19There is only one solution for the second case:11+11=22Note that 01+21=22 is not a valid solution because extra leading zeros are not allowed.",
