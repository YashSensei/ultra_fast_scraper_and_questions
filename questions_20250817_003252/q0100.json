  "text": "Is there anyone who doesn't love geometry?! Just imagine: on the plane you are given a square ABCD, with vertices given in the clockwise direction. Also given is a point P which is different from all of A, B, C or D. Have you imagined it? Interested? Ok, let's continue!Through vertex A a lineais drawn that is perpendicular to line BP, through vertex B a linebis drawn that is perpendicular to line CP, through vertex C a linecis drawn that is perpendicular to line DP, through vertex D a linedis drawn that is perpendicular to line AP. Do the linesa,b,canddcross each other in one point? Ok, it depends on what the square is and what point P is given. Write the program that discovers if these lines cross in one point, and if so, finds the coordinates of this point.InputIn the first line you are given the integer coordinates of the point in which diagonals of the square intersect. In the second line you are given one integer - the length of the side of the square. In the third line you are given the integer coordinates of point P. The integers do not exceed 100, in terms of absolute value.OutputFor each test case you must output YES if the sought point exists, and NO otherwise. If you answer YES then in the second line you must output the coordinates of the intersection point. Coordinates must be rounded to one digit after the point.ExampleInput:10 10\r\n20\r\n5 12Output:YES\r\n8.0 5.0Author: Filimonenkov D.O.",
