  "text": "A string is called a square string if it can be obtained by concatenating two copies of the same string (i.e. $s=uu$ for some word $u$). For example, \"abab\", \"aa\" are square strings, while \"aaa\", \"abba\" are not. A string is called prefix-square free if none of its prefixes is a square.Chiaki would like to know the number of nonempty prefix-square free strings whose length is less than or equal to $n$. The size of the alphabet Chiaki uses is $m$. As this number may be very large, Chiaki is only interested in its remainder modulo $2^{32}$.InputThere are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le 100$), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100, 1 \\le m \\le 10^9$) -- the length of the string and the size of the alphabet.OutputFor each test case, output an integer denoting the answer.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 2\r\n4 6Output:8\r\n1266InformationThere are $5$ input files:Input #1: $1 \\le T \\le 100, 1 \\le n \\le 10$.Input #2: $1 \\le T \\le 50, 1 \\le n \\le 30$.Input #3: $1 \\le T \\le 30, 1 \\le n \\le 60$.Input #4: $1 \\le T \\le 10, 1 \\le n \\le 80$.Input #5: $1 \\le T \\le 2, 1 \\le n \\le 100$.",
