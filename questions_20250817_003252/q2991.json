  "text": "As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. Beside of growing vegetable she also breeds greenflies. There are many kinds of greenflies and it is not trivial to breed them since they behave very strangely. Each kind of greenfly is known under a number. As you have multiple greenflies in a single coop, they produce as much juice as the greatest common divisor of their numbers.Ada owns a row of greenflies (of several kinds) and she can split them by a fence, so that always a continuous segment of greenflies will be in a same coopAda wants to find out the sum of production of greenflies  over all possible continuous segments (of size at least one), can you help her?InputThe first line contains an integer1 ≤ N ≤ 3*105, the number of greenflies in row.The second line containsNintegers0 ≤ ai≤     106OutputPrint a single line: the sum of production of all continuous segments.Example Input5\r\n2 2 3 6 2Example Output29Example Input 27\r\n2 4 6 12 18 6 4Example Output 2118Example Input 35\r\n2 4 8 16 32Example Output 3114Example Input 44\r\n12 20 20 5Example Output 496",
