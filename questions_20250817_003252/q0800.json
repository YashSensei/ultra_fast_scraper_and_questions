But he remember thatwidth = 2 * radiusof marble and width is also an integer. You can assume that all marble are same.Now, Minas will give youL, HandK. You need to tell him the width of the box. If the width is less than 1 then print-1.InputInput starts with an integerT (1<=T<=1000), denoting the number of test cases.Each case contains 3 integerL (1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9),H (1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9)andK (1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9).OutputFor each case of input, print the case number as\"Case #: x\",#is replaced by the case number starting from 1 andxis replaced by themaximum possiblewidth of the box.ExampleInput:1\r\n2 2 4Output:Case 1: 1",
