  "text": "Professor Mahammad was sitting in his garden when an apple fell on his head, and in a stroke of brilliant insight, he suddenly came up withK-dominant notation. An array with lengthLis calledK-dominant, if and only if there is at least one elementxlying in the array for whichoccurrence(x) * K >= L. After analyzing several arrays with this property, professor now, made up a new problem for you. Your task is simple, there are given an array of length N and several queries. For each of the queries, you just need to check whetherthe subarray [l, r] is k-dominant or not.InputThe first line of the input contains two positive integersNandQ, the number of elements of the array and the mean, respectively. (N, Q ≤ 200000).The following line contains N integers which represent elements of the array.The following Q lines contains three integersl,r, andk. (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N).All the numbers in the input section are 32-bit positive integers.Sum of all k's in queries does not exceed 500000.OutputFor each of the queries, print per lineYESorNOif there is an element lying in the subarray which satisfies the condition in the statement.ExampleInput:8 3\r\n1 4 2 3 2 2 5 3\r\n2 6 2\r\n1 8 2\r\n1 8 3Output:YES\r\nNO\r\nYESNote: For the first and third queries x = 2 satisfies the condition. And for the second query there is no element for which the condition holds true.",
