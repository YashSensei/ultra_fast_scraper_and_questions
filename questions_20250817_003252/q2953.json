Now he wants to know the number of ways he can put marbles in these three boxes when the following conditions hold.Each box must contain at least 1 marble.The summation of marbles of the 3 boxes must be in between X and Y inclusive.Now you are given X and Y. You have to find the number of ways Mr. Ant can put marbles in the 3 boxes.InputInput starts with an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integersXandY.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 10000001 ≤ X ≤  Y ≤ 1000000OutputFor each test case, print the required answer modulo1000000007.ExampleInput:1\r\n4 5Output:9Explanation for the first test case112Way 01113Way 02121Way 03131Way 04211Way 05311Way 06122Way 07212Way 08221Way 09Note: use faster i/o method.Problem Setter: Md Abdul Alim, Dept. of Computer Science, Bangladesh University of Business & Technology",
