  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is currently on a trip on appletree. There are many apples on the tree connected with branches. Each apple is inhabited by either Psylloideas or by Woolly Apple Aphids. Psylloideas and Aphids doesn't like each other, so it is strictly prohibited to walk from apple of Psylloideas to apple of aphids (and vice versa). Ada has some questions, whether it is possible to go from nodeIto nodeJ.Anyway note, that as Aphids and Psyllodeas doesn't like each other, they sometime conquer an apple of the others. Also note, that it is a real apple tree (not some bush) so no apple is connected with more than 50 other apples.InputThe first line contains1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 3*105, number apples on tree and number for queries.The next line containsNcharacters (either 0 or 1), indicating whetherithapple belongs to Psyllodeas or to Aphids.NextN-1lines contains two numbers, the branches (edges) of apple tree (0 ≤ I, J < N,I ≠ J).Each of followingQlines contains one of following types of queries:0 I,0 ≤ I < N, meaning that ownership ofIthapple has changed.1 I J,0 ≤ I, J < N, question, whether it is possible to go fromIthtoJthapple.OutputFor each query of second kind (1) print \"YES\", if it is possible or \"NO\" if it is impossible!Example Input8 11\r\n00111100\r\n0 1\r\n1 7\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n2 6\r\n2 4\r\n4 5\r\n1 1 2\r\n1 0 7\r\n1 6 5\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 6 7\r\n0 2\r\n1 1 2\r\n1 0 7\r\n1 6 5\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 6 7Example OutputNO\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nYES\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nNO\r\nYES",
