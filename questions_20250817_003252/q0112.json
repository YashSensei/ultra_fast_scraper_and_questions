  "text": "In a far away nation, all the liquid substance are stored in a can of shape of a triangular prism. According to belief, this will bring security to their children. As they are very resource conservative people, unlike the earth natives, they want to use as less as possible amount of the raw material to be used for producing the can, which directly depends on the surface area of the can. Mr. Buzz Light Year, of Star Command, is provided with the responsiblity to find the minimal suface area required to prodce a can of a given volume.Notes:Consider the material the can is made of to be infinitely thin.The base of the prism is equilateral triangle.Some formulas:a: triangle side's length.h: height of the prism.Volume, V =  (a2* sin(60°) * h)/2Surface Area, S = a2*sin(60°) + 3*a*hIf not provided by a library, use the alue of 2*acos(0) for PI(π).Reminder:If your result iswithin 10-2of the expected result, your solution will be evaluated as correct.If your result isbetween (1-10-2)*expected and (1+10-2)*expected, it will be evaluated as correct.ConstraintsGiven volume will be an integer between 1 and 100000, inclusive.InputInput begins with a integer t, number of test cases. Then follows t lines, each one containing an integer, V, given volume.OutputFor each volume, print the minimum surface area required to produce the can in separate line.ExampleInput:5\r\n10\r\n5\r\n100\r\n245\r\n5421Output:30.3872837089\r\n19.1427891970\r\n141.0452767471\r\n256.3318686611\r\n2020.2796324002Explanation for test case 1:Volume = 10, a = 3.41995,  h = 1.97451, Minimum Surface Area = 30.3872837089",
