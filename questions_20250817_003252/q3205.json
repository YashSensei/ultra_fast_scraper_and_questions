(1, 2, 2, 3) == (22, 3, 4, 22), with r=2 and f(22)=2, f(3)=3 and f(4)=1. But (22, 3, 22, 4) is not equal to (1, 2, 2, 3).How many different vectors are there in set of N given vectors?Constraintsn ≤ 10000k ≤ 100vector values are from range [0, 109]InputFirst number contains T (T ≤ 10), number of test cases. Each test cases consists of following. First line consists of N and K. N lines follows, the i-th containing K integers describing i-th vector.OutputOutput one number, number of different vectors.Input:2\r\n3 4\r\n22 3 4 22\r\n1 2 2 3\r\n22 3 22 4\r\n5 5\r\n3 3 3 0 3\r\n8 4 4 4 0\r\n1 1 1 1 1\r\n1 1 8 6 1\r\n1 3 3 3 5Output:2\r\n3",
