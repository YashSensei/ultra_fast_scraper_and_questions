  "text": "ADigit Rootis a feature of numbers used in mathematical recreation, but can also be used to check the results of simple operations such as sum and multiplication. One of its main properties is that theDigit Rootof a number is always equal toDigit Rootof the sum of its digits.For example, theDigit Rootof 18446744073709551615 is the same as 87 because 1 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 7 + 3 + 7 + 0 + 9 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 5 = 87, and is the same of 15 because 8 + 7 = 15, which in turn is the same as 6, since 1 + 5 = 6. Therefore theDigit Rootof all these numbers is 6 since 6 is its ownDigit Root.Your task is, given the two integers,BandE, calculate theDigit RootofBE(Braised to theE-th power).InputThe input consists of two lines. The first contains the numberB(1 ≤B≤ 10105). The second contains the numberE(1 ≤E≤ 10105).OutputThe output consists of a single line containing theDigit Root.ExampleInput:2\r\n7Output:2Input:25\r\n5Output:4Input:6\r\n10Output:9",
