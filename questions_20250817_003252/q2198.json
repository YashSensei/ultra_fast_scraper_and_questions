  "text": "One day Manku was very thirsty  so he decided to drink exactly z litres of water. However , in front of him, there is a well of infinite amount of water and 2 empty jugs of quantity x litres and y litres respectively.Now Manku can do the following operations to any jugFill it completely from the wellEmpty it entirelyTransfer as much water from Jug 1 to Jug 2, until Jug 1 gets empty or Jug 2 is completely filled.Now since he has no measuring device so he will do these operations only to make any of the 2 jug having exactly z litres of water.Now Your task is given value of x, y, z, tell whether it is possible for Manku to drink water or not.InputFirst Line of Input contains T, the number of test cases. (T <= 25)Then for each test case there are 3 numbers x, y, z given in separate line.1 <= x <= 10^81 <= y <= 10^81 <= z <= 10^8OutputFor each test case outputÂ \"YES\" if manku can drink exactly z litres of water else \"NO\".ExampleInput:5\r\n2 4 3\r\n2 5 1\r\n9 3 6\r\n3 8 7\r\n6 1 10Output:NO\r\nYES\r\nYES\r\nYES\r\nNOExplanationIn Test case 1 Either Manku can have 2 or 4 litres of water so he cant drink 3 litres.In Test case 2 Manku can have 1 litre water by doing the following operations:Fill 2 litre JugTransfer its water to 5 litre JugAgain Fill 2 litre JugAgain Transfer its entire water to 5 litre JugNow 5 litre Jug will have total 4 litre waterAgain Fill 2 litre JugNow transfer 1 litre water to 5 litre Jugbecause at present 5 litre Jug don't have space for more than 1 litre waterNow the 2 litre Jug will have only 1 litre water leftFor Test case 3 we will transfer 3 litre water twice from 3 litre jug to 9 litre jugFor test Case 4,transfer 3 times water of 3 litre jug to 8 litre jugUltimately 3 litre Jug has 1 litre water left and 8 litre Jug is fullNow empty 8 litre jug and pour remaining 1 litre of 3 litre jug in itNow fill 3 litre jug fully twice and transfer its water to 8 litre jugNow 8 litre Jug will have 7 litre waterFor Test case 5, we cant have 10 litre of water in any jug",
