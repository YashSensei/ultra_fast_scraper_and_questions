  "text": "In this problem you will be given a half-circle. The half-circle’s radius isr. \r\nYou can take any point A on the half-circle and draw 2 lines from the point to the two sides of the diameter(AB and AC). Let the sum of square of one line’s length and the other line’s length issLike in the figures=AB2+AC. AndBC= 2r.Now givenryou have to find the maximum value ofs. That is you have to find point A such thatAB2+ACis maximum.InputFirst line of the test case will be the number of test case T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000). Then T lines follows. On each line you will find a integer numberr(1 ≤r≤ 1000000); each representing the radius of the half-circle.OutputFor each input line, print a line containing\"Case I: \", where I is the test case number and the maximum value ofs. Print 2 digit after decimal (Errors should be less then .01).ExampleSample Input:1\r\n1Sample Output:Case 1: 4.25",
