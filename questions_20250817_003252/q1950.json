  "text": "Sailor Crow'n-beard has many pieces of rope. Every piece has a different value and it is well known that money equals quality. Crow'n-beard wants you to create a program that given pieces of rope, creates a rope with the length as close as possible to his desired length (but never too short) while maximizing the quality.InputInput describes a single test case. The first line contains two integersN(1 ≤N≤ 80) andL(1 ≤L≤ 10000): the number of rope pieces Crow'n-beard and the desired length respectively. ThenNlines will follow, each with two integers: the lengthLi(0 ≤Li< 2^31) followed by the valueVi(0 ≤Vi≤ 26843545) of the piece of rope. It is guaranteed that the sum ofLiis never less thanL.OutputYou should output the maximal total quality you can reach. Remember that the priority is to get the smallest total length that is still at least equal toL. Only then output the best total quality amongst equal length solutions.SampleInput:4 4\r\n20 2\r\n1 4\r\n3 4\r\n4 7Output:8",
