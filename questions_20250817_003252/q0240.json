  "text": "Your younger brother has an assignment and needs some help. His teacher gave him a sequence of numbers to be sorted in ascending order. During the sorting process, the places of two numbers can be interchanged. Each interchange has a cost, which is the sum of the two numbers involved.You must write a program that determines the minimal cost to sort the sequence of numbers.InputThe input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (n>1), representing the number of items to be sorted. The second line contains n different integers (each positive and less than 1000), which are the numbers to be sorted.The input is terminated by a zero on a line by itself.OutputFor each test case, the output is a single line containing the test case number and the minimal cost of sorting the numbers in the test case.Place a blank line after the output of each test case.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 2 1\r\n4\r\n8 1 2 4\r\n5\r\n1 8 9 7 6\r\n6\r\n8 4 5 3 2 7\r\n0Output:Case 1: 4\r\n\r\nCase 2: 17\r\n\r\nCase 3: 41\r\n\r\nCase 4: 34",
