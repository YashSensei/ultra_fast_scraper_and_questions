  "text": "Given a number N, you are asked to count the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N.Two integers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if they have no common positive divisors other than 1 or, equivalently, if their greatest common divisor is 1. The number 1 is relatively prime to every integer.InputThe first line on input contains T (0 < T ≤ 100) the number of test cases, each of the next T lines contains three integers A, B, N where (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1015) and (1 ≤ N ≤ 109).OutputFor each test case, print the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N. Follow the output format below.SampleInput:2\r\n1 10 2\r\n3 15 5Output:Case #1: 5\r\nCase #2: 10In the first test case, the five integers in range [1, 10] which are relatively prime to 2 are {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.",
