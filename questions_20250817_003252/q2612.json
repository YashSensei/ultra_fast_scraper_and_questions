  "text": "A number issquare-freeif its prime decomposition contains no repeated factors. For example: 1001 = 7 × 11 × 13 is square-free, but 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 is not square-free.Square-free numbers can be encoded as binary numbers. Here are examples to illustrate:Sequence of prime numbers 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 ...42 = 2 × 3 × 7     → 11011001 = 7 × 11 × 13 → 00011110 = 2 × 5         → 101Your task is given two square-free integers A and B in binary representation compute gcd (A + B, lcm (A, B)). If the result is a square-free number your answer should have the binary format, if the answer is 1 print \"relatively prime\", and if is neither of these two cases print the result in base 10.InputIn the first line an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) the number of test cases.\r\nThe following 2 × T lines will appear integers A and B. The length of the integers A and B encoded in binary form must not exceed 1000 characters.OutputFor each of the T pairs A, B print in the specified format gcd (A + B, lcm (A, B)).ExampleInput:2\r\n000111\r\n101\r\n11\r\n011Output:relatively prime\r\n01Note:In the input may have unnecessary zeros on the right of the numbers A and B, but your answer must only have necessary zeros.",
