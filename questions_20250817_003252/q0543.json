  "text": "EnglishVietnameseMirko decided to open a new business – bank vaults. A branch of the bank can be visualized in a plane, vaults being points in the plane. Mirko's branch contains exactly L·(A+1+B) vaults, so that each point\r\nwith integer coordinates inside the rectangle with corners (1, −A) and (L, B) contains one vault.The vaults are watched by two guards – one at (0, −A), the other at (0, B). A guard can see a vault if\r\nthere are no other vaults on the line segment connecting them.A vault is not secure if neither guard can see it, secure if only one guard can see it and super-secure if\r\nboth guards can see it.Given A, B and L, output the number of insecure, secure and super-secure vaults.InputThe first line contains integers A and B separated by a space (1 ≤ A ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ B ≤ 2000).The second line contains the integer L (1 ≤ L ≤ 1 000 000 000).OutputOutput on three separate lines the numbers of insecure, secure and super-secure vaults.ExampleInput:1 1\r\n3Output:2\r\n2\r\n5Input:2 3\r\n4Output:0\r\n16\r\n8Input:7 11\r\n1000000Output:6723409\r\n2301730\r\n9974861",
