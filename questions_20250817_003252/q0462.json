  "text": "Two positive integers (without any leading zeroes) are said to be anagrams of each other if the digits in one integer (in decimal notation) can be rearranged to form the other.You are given two integersNandK. Your task is to find the maximum anagramXofN, which divides byKwithout remainder.  IfXdoesn't exist, output -1 instead.InputSeveral test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with two positive integersNandK(1 <=K<= 10) without any leading zeroes, separated by a single space. The number of digits inNdoesn't exceed 1000.In each test file, the number of \"large\"  test cases is relatively small.Input terminates by EOF.OutputFor each test case, output the maximum possible value ofXin a single line. IfXdoesn't exist, output -1 instead.ExampleInput:21 5\r\n2023 7Output:-1\r\n3220",
