  "text": "One of the basics of Computer Science is knowing how numbers are represented in 2's complement. Imagine that you write down all numbers between A and B in 2's complement representation using 32 bits. How many 1's will you write down in all?InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two integers A and B.OutputOutput T lines, one corresponding to each test case.Constraints:-231≤ A ≤ B ≤ 231- 1SampleInput:3\r\n-2 0\r\n-3 4\r\n-1 4Output:63\r\n99\r\n37ExplanationFor the first case, -2 contains 31 1's followed by a 0 whereas -1 contains 32 1's. Thus the total is 63.For the second case, the answer is 31 + 31 + 32 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 99",
