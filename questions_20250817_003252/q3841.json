  "text": "Two natural numbersnandmare said to becoprimeif their greatest common divisor is the number1. In other words,nandmare coprime if there is no integerd > 1such thatdexactly divides bothnandm. A finite set of two or more consecutive natural numbers is called a \"stapled interval\" if there is no number in it that is coprime to all other numbers in the set.Given a range[A, B], we would like to count the number of stapled intervals completely contained in it. I.e., we want to know how many different pairs(a, b)exist such thatA ≤ a < b ≤ Band the set{a, a+1, ..., b}is a stapled interval.InputThe first line contains an integerPrepresenting the number of questions you should answer (1≤P≤1000). Each of the followingPlines describes a question, and contains two integer numbersAandBrepresenting the borders of the range[A, B]in which we want to count stapled intervals (1≤A≤B≤107).OutputPrintPlines, each with a single integer number. Fori = 1, 2, ..., Pthe number in thei-th line represents the number of stapled intervals completely contained in the range[A, B]corresponding to thei-th question.ExampleInput:4\r\n2184 2200\r\n2185 2200\r\n2184 2199\r\n1 100000Output:1\r\n0\r\n0\r\n13",
