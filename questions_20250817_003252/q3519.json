  "text": "Supervin likes counting. In this problem, he invites you to count together.Supervin defines awordas \"a string only consist of 'o' or 'x'\", and additional requirement, for each substring with prime-length, the number of 'o' is not less than the number of 'x'.Supervin gives you an integerN(1 ≤N≤ 1012). Supervin challenges you to determine how manywordscan be made with exactlyN-length.You are having difficulties, make a program to determine how manyN-lengthwords. Because the output can be too big, output the number ofwordsmodulo 1 000 000 007.InputOne line, an integerNOutputOne line, an integer indicates how manyN-lengthwordsmodulo 1 000 000 007ExampleInput:2Output:3Input:3Output:4ExplanationIn the first sample, thewordscan be made are: \"oo\", \"ox\", \"xo\".In the second sample, thewordscan be made are: \"ooo\", \"oox\", \"oxo\", \"xoo\"",
