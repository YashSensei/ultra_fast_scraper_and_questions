Now you are provided n and nth term of the sequence. Find the first term of the given series.InputInput contains only three integers n, nth term and p separated by spaces.Here n will be between 1 to 1000000000 inclusive.and each term ranges between 0 to 1000000006 inclusive.OutputOutput a single integer that is first term of the sequence.ExampleInput:5 32 2Output:2",
