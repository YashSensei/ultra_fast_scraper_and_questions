Each test case is composed of four space separated integers. The first two numbers, a, b, are the starting position of the knight and the next two, c, d, are the destination of the knight. Read up to End Of File.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum amount of bucks they had to pay in separate line. If it's impossible to reach the destination then print -1.ExampleInput:2 5 5 2\r\n4 7 3 2\r\n1 2 3 4Output:42\r\n78\r\n18Explanation for Test Case 1For moving knight from (2, 5) to (5, 2) in minimum cost, one of the path is (2, 5) → (3, 3) → (5, 2)Bucks paid:(2, 5) → (3, 3) = (2 × 3 + 5 × 3) = 21(3, 3) → (5, 2) = (3 × 5 + 3 × 2) = 21Total cost = 42To infinity and beyond...",
