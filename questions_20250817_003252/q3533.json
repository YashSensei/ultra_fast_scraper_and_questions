  "text": "Leo would like to play with some really big numbers, OK...Let  FIB  the Fibonacci function :FIB(0)=0 ; FIB(1)=1andfor N>=2  FIB(N) = FIB(N-1) + FIB(N-2)Example : we have FIB(6)=8, and FIB(8)=21, so FIB(FIB(6))=21InputThe input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.In each of the next T lines there are an integer N.OutputFor each test case, print  FIB(FIB(N)) ,as the answer could not fit in a 64bit container,give your answer modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n0\r\n5\r\n6Output:0\r\n5\r\n21Constraints1 <= T <= 10^4\r\n0 <= N <= 10^100Time limit is set to allow (sub-optimal) 500B of python3 code to get AC.A near optimal solution is within 0.02 and 0.04s with a fast language, and around 1s in Python2 without psyco.Edit(20/I/2015) With Cube cluster, it is not hard to get 0.0s with fast languages, and my old code ended in 0.08s using PY3.4.Edit(11-2-2017) With compiler update, new TL. My old Python code ends in 0.04s, and it's easy to get 0.00s using a fast language.",
