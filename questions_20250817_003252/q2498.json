The exercise demanded Swampy to report all valid email-id's in a given free-form text string. Check output section for exact specification. Swampy lacks the intelligence of humans and therefore needs you to help him in this job.  The chapter defined email-id's as a string consisting of two parts.

There is no space character in the email-id.  The entire email-id is \"username@site-address\".InputFirst line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of String S on a single line. S is made up of characters {a-z A-Z 0-9 ~!@#$%^&*()<>?,.} (excluding the brackets) and space character too.OutputFor each test case, print Case #X: K, where X is the test case number starting from 1, K is the number of email-id's found in S, and then K lines with email-id's found in S.ExampleInput:2\r\nsvm11@gmail.com\r\nsvm11@gmail.com svm12@gmail.co.inOutput:Case #1: 1\r\nsvm11@gmail.com\r\nCase #2: 2\r\nsvm11@gmail.com\r\nsvm12@gmail.co.inConstraints: T ≤ 100 |S| ≤ 10000",
