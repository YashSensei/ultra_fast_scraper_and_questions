  "text": "Druid (AKA Amr Alaa El-Deen) and little EOIers have finished their training and they are playing \"Fatta7y ya warda!\". It's a kids game when everyone holds hands with two other kids forming a circle, and they keep saying \"Fatta7y ya warda!\" (Flourish, flower!) (moving away from each other, while still holding hands, to form a huge circle), then \"2affely ya warda!\" (Die, flower!) (moving back as close to each other as possible, while still holding hands, to form a tiny circle, i.e. a point). That's it!Anyway the point is...While Eagle (AKA Mohamed Ahmed) was watching them playing he was wondering, who's the first person taller than Druid on his left? Similarly, who's the first person taller than Druid on his right? Help Eagle find the answer for each person not just Druid.InputThe input starts with an integerT(1 ≤T≤ 20), the number of test cases.Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integerN(1 ≤N≤ 105), the number of persons playing the game. The second line containsNintegershi(1 ≤hi≤ 109) the height of thei-th person. They are numbered 1 toNstarting from Druid.OutputFor each test case printNlines, in thei-th line print 2 numbers, the index of the first person taller than thei-th person on his left, and the index of the first person taller than thei-th person on his right. If no one is taller than thei-th person print -1 -1.ExampleInput:3\r\n5\r\n172 170 168 171 169\r\n3\r\n172 169 172\r\n1\r\n172Output:-1 -1\r\n1 4\r\n2 4\r\n1 1\r\n4 1\r\n-1 -1\r\n1 3\r\n-1 -1\r\n-1 -1NoteThe third sample:",
