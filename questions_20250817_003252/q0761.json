  "text": "You are given a tree withNnodes.  \r\nThe tree nodes are numbered from1toN.  \r\nEach node has an integer weight.We will ask you to perform the following operation:u v: ask for how many different integers that represent the weight of nodes there are on the path fromutov.InputIn the first line there are two integersNandM. (N≤ 40000,M≤ 100000)In the second line there areNintegers. The i-th integer denotes the weight of the i-th node.In the nextN-1lines, each line contains two integersuv, which describes an edge (u,v).In the nextMlines, each line contains two integersuv, which means an operation asking for how many different integers that represent the weight of nodes there are on the path fromutov.OutputFor each operation, print its result.ExampleInput:8 2\r\n105 2 9 3 8 5 7 7\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n3 5\r\n3 6\r\n3 7\r\n4 8\r\n2 5\r\n7 8Output:4\r\n4",
