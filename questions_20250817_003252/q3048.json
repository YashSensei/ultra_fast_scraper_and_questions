  "text": "As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has a long furrow in which she grows vegetable (while each vegetable is identified by a bloom-value). The more vegetable is in the furrow the bigger risk of mold there is. More specifically the mold-value can be obtained as sum ofxorof all pairs of vegetable's bloom-values.Ada has bought a few wooden separators which could possibly reduce the mold-value. It works in following manner: she can put the separators between some plants, dividing the furrow into multiple segments. The mold-value will then becomes the sum of mold-values of all the segments (independently). Can you find the minimal possible mold-value?InputThe first line of input contains two integersN, K:1 ≤ K < N ≤     5000, the length of furrows and the number of separators.The next lines will containNnumbers0 ≤ Ai≤     109, the bloom-values of vegetable.OutputOutput the minimal possible mold-value.Example Input6 1\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6Example Output12Example Input 14 3\r\n5 3 5 3Example Output 10Example Input 27 2\r\n5 3 5 3 5 3 4Example Output2124Example Input 39 4\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 666 1024Example Output 38Example Input 430 8\r\n629470789 417274987 617986533 841737683 297969800 432044389 708142005 156958893 499363651 434034331 176735187 525172817 747109631 949700868 259681519 357968078 818249370 456939952 450487335 529013233 327250536 90354657 643708145 141755216 656041628 661580907 204072850 469709611 834069223 681347499Example Output 416154467281",
