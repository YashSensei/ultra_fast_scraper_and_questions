  "text": "For a directed graphGwhere any vertexvhas two  weightsAvandBv, we callAu+Bvthe weight of a edge (u,v). LetMaxEdge(G)  be the maximum weight of the edges ofG.Given a permutationPon 1..n, we can derive a directed graphG=(V,E)  whereV={1,..,n} and (u,v) inEiffP(u)=v. Your task is to computeMaxEdge(Pk)  for everykin 0..q-1.InputThe first line contains a positive integern.The second line  containsnintegers in {1,..,n}, denoting the permutationP.The  third and the fourth line both containnnatural numbers,A1,..,AnandB1,..,Bnrespectively.The fifth line contains a  positive integerq.OutputThe only one line containsqintegersMaxEdge(P0),..,MaxEdge(Pq-1), separated by a single space.ExampleInput:33 2 10 1 22 2 05Output:3 4 3 4 3Constraintn<= 66000Ai,Bi<= 16q<= 106NoticeThe time limit is somehow strict.
