  "text": "Given a undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. Your task is count the number of distinct pairs (u, v) that there is exist a path with length exactly 2 from u to v. Another mean, with each pair (u, v), we could find a vertex t that we have an edge (u, t) and (t, v). The input set may be contains multiple edge between any vertex and not consider to connected.Input- First line: n, m (1 <= n, m <= 10^5).- m following line: u, v (1 <= u, v <= n).OutputThe number of distinct pairs.ExampleInput:5 42 11 53 14 3Output:4Note:we have (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5)",
