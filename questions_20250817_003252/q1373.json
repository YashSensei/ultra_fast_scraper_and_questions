  "text": "Let R be a rectangle with integer side lengths. The rectangle is divided into unit squares. Considering one of the diagonals, we denote by f(R) the number of squares which have a common interior point with it. For example, if the side lengths of R are 2 and 4 then f(R)=4. Write a program to find out the number of all different rectangles R for which f(R) = N. Two rectangles with sides a × b and b × a are not different.InputIn a single line of the standard input the integer N (0 < N < 106) is given.OutputThe only line of the standard output should contain an integer – the calculated number of rectangle.Sample Input4Sample Output4Problem for kid - Please, think like kid.",
