  "text": "Let a given sequence S (of length n) of positive integers be called x-medial (where x is a positive integer) if:n is odd, and the median of the sequence (the ((n+1)/2)thlargest term) equals x.ORn is even, and both the central terms ((n/2)thlargest and (n/2+1)thlargest) are equal to x.Given a sequence A (of length N) of positive integers and an integer k, find out how many of its sub-sequences are k-medial.A sub-sequence of A is any sequence {A[i], A[i+1], A[i+2] ... A[j]}, where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < N.InputThe first line contains T (T ≤ 15), the number of test cases.Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line contains the numbers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 109), separated by a single space.The next line contains the sequence A (N terms, each ≤ 109, separated by single spaces between them).OutputOutput T lines, each containing a single integer, equal to the number of k-medial sub-sequences.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 5\r\n17 5 2\r\n5 2\r\n1 2 2 3 7Output:2\r\n7",
