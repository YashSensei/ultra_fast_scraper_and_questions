  "text": "Rishi loves numbers and number patterns very much.\r\nHe is interested in finding OE numbers in a range [a, b].\r\nAn OE number is a number whose sum of even digits [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] is greater than sum of odd digits [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].\r\nHelp him to count how many OE numbers are in range [a, b] {a and b inclusive}Example: \r\n  - 4563: O = 5+3   = 8, E = 4+6 = 10, E > O, so 4563 is an OE number\r\n  - 1233, O = 1+3+3 = 7, E = 2,        E < O, so 1233 is not an OE number\r\n  -   10, O = 1,         E = 0         E < O, so 10 is not an OE numberInputThe first line of the input file containsTwhich denotes the number of Test cases.\r\nThe nextTlines contains two space separated integersaandb.1 ≤a≤b≤ 108T≤ 35.OutputPrint the number of OE numbers in range [a,b] {one number per line}ExampleInput:3\r\n1 1\r\n2 10\r\n1 100000000Output:0\r\n4\r\n38379932",
