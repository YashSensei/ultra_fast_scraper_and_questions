  "text": "Given a graph with N (2 ≤ N ≤ 5,000) vertices numbered 1 to N and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 30,000) undirected, weighted edges, compute themaximum flow / minimum cutfrom vertex 1 to vertex N.InputThe first line contains the two integers N and M. The next M lines each contain three integers A, B, and C, denoting that there is an edge of capacity C (1 ≤ C ≤ 109) between nodes A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N). Note that it is possible for there to be duplicate edges, as well as an edge from a node to itself.OutputPrint a single integer (which may not fit into a 32-bit integer) denoting the maximum flow / minimum cut between 1 and N.ExampleInput:4 6\r\n1 2 3\r\n2 3 4\r\n3 1 2\r\n2 2 5\r\n3 4 3\r\n4 3 3Output:5Viewing the problem as max-flow, we may send 3 units of flow through the path 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 and 2 units of flow through the path 1 - 3 - 4. Viewing the problem as min-cut, we may cut the first and third edges. Either way the total is 5.Note: see alsoMATCHING.",
