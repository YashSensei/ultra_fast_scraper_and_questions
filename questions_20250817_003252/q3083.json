  "text": "One day, mathematician and philosopher were engaged in a heated dispute.Philosopher said:- Ideal line has only length and no width, therefore, no line can have an area.Mathematician replied:- That's as it may be, but still you can fill a square with a line in such a way that there will be no gaps.And you can't deny that a square has an area, and he grinned.But Philosopher still wasn't convinced:- Show me this line, then.- With pleasure... - responded Mathematician and scribbled some equations on a piece of paper:- With t increasing, the point (x, y) will move around the square, forming a line.- So what? - asked Philosopher. How is it going to ll the entire square?- Indeed, it will, - said Mathematician, - Whichever point inside the square you draw, the line will eventually cross that point.- No, - replied Philosopher indignantly, - Anyway, I don't believe. When will the line cross this point? - and he put a thick dot inside the square.Give Philosopher an answer.Inputtâ€“ number of tests [t<= 150], than t test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains the coordinates (x0, y0) of the dot center (-1 <= x0, y0 <= 1). The second line contains eps <= 0.0001 - the radius of the dot (the dot is essentially a small circle).OutputFor each test case output any value of t in the segment [0, 10^12], which corresponds to the line crossing the dot, or \"FAIL\", if the line doesn't cross the dot.ExampleSample input:1\r\n0.744 0.554\r\n0.01Sample output:5.3",
