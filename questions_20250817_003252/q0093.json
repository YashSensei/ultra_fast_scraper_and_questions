Your task is to find the smallest partial sum moduloPthat is at leastK.For example, consider the following sequence of integers:12     13     15     11     16     26     11HereN= 7. SupposeK= 2 andP= 17. Then, the answer is 2 because 11 + 16  + 26 = 53 and 53 mod 17 is 2. On the other hand, ifK= 0 the answer is 0 since 15 + 11 + 16 + 26 = 68 and 68 mod 17 is 0.You may assume 1 ≤N≤ 100000.InputThe first line of the input contains the number of test cases,T.Each test case begins with a line containing three integers,N,KandP. This is followed by the values ofa1,a2, ...,aN, one per line.OutputOutput one line per test case, containing the smallest partial sum moduloPthat is at leastK, as described above.ExampleInput:1\r\n7 2 17\r\n12\r\n13\r\n15\r\n11\r\n16\r\n26\r\n11Output:2Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
