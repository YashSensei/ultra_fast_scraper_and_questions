  "text": "Given an array of n integers and a number x. Your task is very simple. You have to find the subarray (length > 0) whose xor is maximum with x. Let's say the subarray as maxsubarray. You have to print the xor value of maxsubarray.InputFirst line of input consists of t test cases.Second line of input contains two integers n and x.Third line contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of array.OutputFirst and only line of output is xor value of maxsubarray.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 101 ≤ n ≤ 2000001 ≤ x ≤ 2×1091 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 2×109where arr[i] is any integer of array.ExampleInput:1\r\n3 7\r\n1 2 3Output:0taking 1^2^3 is 0 when taken xor with 7 gives us the maximum xor value.",
