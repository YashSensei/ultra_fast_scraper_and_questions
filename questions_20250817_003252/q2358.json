  "text": "The game of 31 was a favourite of con artists who rode the railroads in days of yore. The game\r\nis played with a deck of 24 cards: four labelled each of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The cards in the deck are\r\nvisible to both players, who alternately withdraw one card from the deck and place it on a pile.\r\nThe object of the game is to be the last player to lay a card such that the sum of the cards in\r\nthe pile does not exceed 31. Your task is to determine the eventual winner of a partially played\r\ngame, assuming each player plays the remainder of the game using a perfect strategy.For example, in the following game player B wins:Player A plays 3Player B plays 5Player A plays 6Player B plays 6Player A plays 5Player B plays 6InputThe input will consist of several lines; each line consists of a sequence of zero or more digits\r\nrepresenting a partially completed game. The first digit is player A's move; the second player\r\nB's move; and so on. You are to complete the game using a perfect strategy for both players\r\nand to determine who wins.OutputFor each game, print a line consisting of the input, followed by a space, followed by A or B to\r\nindicate the eventual winner of the game.ExampleInput:356656\r\n35665\r\n3566\r\n111126666\r\n552525Output:356656 B\r\n35665 B\r\n3566 A\r\n111126666 A\r\n552525 A",
