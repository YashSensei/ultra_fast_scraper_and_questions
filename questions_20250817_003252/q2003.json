  "text": "Hasan Jaddouh has invented a new algorithm for generating permutations this algorithm takes an array with length N as input and generate a permutation with length N from this array.The array must satisfy (1 ≤ Ai ≤ i) in order for the resulting array to be a permutation. Here is the pseudo code of the algorithm:read N\r\nfor i=1 to N do\r\n    read A[i]\r\nfor i=1 to N do\r\n    for j=1 to i-1 do\r\n        if A[j] >= A[i] do\r\n            A[j] = A[j]+1\r\nfor i=1 to N do\r\n    print A[i]but unfortunately for Hasan Jaddouh, his algorithm is too slow for big arrays so he asked you to help him to find a fast way to implement his algorithm.your program should read input same as the pseudocode and output the new array.Inputfirst line contains integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).second line contains N integers separated by spaces each integer is between 1 and 109inclusive.Note: in order for Hasan Jaddouh's algorithm to work and generate a permutation the constraint (1 ≤ Ai ≤ i) must be satisfied but to make this problem harder this constraint isnotguaranteed so it's also not necessary that the output is a permutation.OutputOutput N integers separated by spaces, the new array after applying Hasan Jaddouh's algorithm.ExampleInput:4\r\n4 2 1 3Output:7 4 1 3",
