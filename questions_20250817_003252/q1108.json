  "text": "Hey, ACRush and Jelly are playing a game ! Let take a look at its rule:You are given a tree. Two players take turns cutting edges on a tree. Some nodes is on the \"ground\".\r\nWhen a player cuts an edge, all the edges that are no longer connected to the ground disappear.\r\nThe player who can not take a move loses.ACRush plays first. Both of them are very good players. If you know state of the tree they are playing with, can you guess who will win?Node 4 is on the ground.InputInput consists of multiple test-cases. The first line contains one integert- number of cases (0 <t≤ 20).\r\n    For each case, the input format is following.\r\n\r\n    The first line contains one integerN(1 ≤N≤ 100000).\r\n    The next lineNintegers s[i] (1 or 0).\r\n    If s[i] is 1, thei-th node is on the ground.\r\n    If s[i] is 0, thei-th node is not on the ground.\r\n\r\n    Each line of the followingN- 1 lines contains two integers u, v.\r\n    They denote there is an edge between node u and node v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N).There is no blank line after each case.OutputFor each case, output who will win the game. If ACRush wins, output1; otherwise, output0(Jelly wins).There is no blank line after each case.ExampleInput:1\r\n4\r\n0 0 0 1\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n2 4Output:1",
