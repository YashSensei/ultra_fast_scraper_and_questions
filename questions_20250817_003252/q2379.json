  "text": "EnglishVietnameseStancu likes space travels but he is a poor software developer and \r\nwill never be able to buy his own spacecraft. That is why he is \r\npreparing to steal the spacecraft of Petru. There is only one problem – \r\nPetru has locked the spacecraft with a sophisticated cryptosystem \r\nbased on the ID numbers of the stars from the Milky Way Galaxy. For \r\nbreaking the system Stancu has to check each subset of \r\nfour stars \r\nsuch that the only common divisor of their numbers is 1. Nasty, isn’t it?Fortunately, Stancu has succeeded to limit the number of the interesting \r\nstars to N but, any way, the possible subsets of four stars can \r\nbe too many. Help him to find their number and to decide if there is \r\na chance to break the system.InputIn the input file several test cases are given. For each test case on \r\nthe first line the number N of interesting stars is given (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000).The second line of the test case contains the list of ID numbers of \r\nthe interesting stars, separated by spaces. Each ID is a positive integer \r\nwhich is no greater than 10000. The input data terminate with the end \r\nof file.OutputFor each test case the program should print one line with  the number \r\nof subsets with the asked property.SampleInput:4  \r\n2 3 4 5 \r\n4 \r\n2 4 6 8 \r\n7 \r\n2 3 4 5 7 6 8Output:1 \r\n0 \r\n34",
