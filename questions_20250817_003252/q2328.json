  "text": "Fred Faculty and Paul Power love big numbers. Day after day Fred chooses a random integernand he computesn!. His friend Paul amuses himself by computing several powers of his randomly chosen integerklikek2,k3and so on. On a hot summer day, Fred and Paul got really, really bored, so they decided to play a joke on their buddy Dave Divider. Fred chooses a random integernwhile Paul chooses a random integerk. They want Dave to find the biggest integerisuch thatkidividesn!without a remainder, otherwise they will throw a cake in Dave's face. Because Dave does not like cakes in his face, he wants you to help him finding that integeri.InputThe first line contains the number of test casest(1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each of the followingtlines contains the two numbersn,k(2 ≤ n ≤ 1018,2 ≤ k ≤ 1012) separated by one space.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum integerion a separate line.ExampleInput:2\r\n5 2\r\n10 10Output:3\r\n2Be careful with overflows in this problem (use 64 bit integers, avoid multiplications which will lead to overflow).",
