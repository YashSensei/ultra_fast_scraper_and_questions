  "text": "It is required to find out what's the maximum number of files that can be deleted from MS-DOS directory\r\nexecuting the DEL command of MS-DOS operation system only once.\r\nThere are no nested subdirectories.NoteDEL command has the following format:DELwildcardThe actual wildcard as well as a full file name can be made up of\r\na name containing 1 up to 8 case-sensitive characters.\r\nIn a wildcard the characters\r\n'?' and '*' can be used. A question mark substitutes exactly one character\r\nof the full file name, an asterisk any sequence of characters even empty one.MS-DOS system can permit maybe other wildcards but they can not be used\r\nin this task. File names\r\nconsist only of Latin letters and digits.InputThe first line of the input is an integer M, then a blank line followed by M datasets. There is a blank line between datasets.Input data for each dataset contains a list of full file names without any extra empty lines\r\nand spaces. Each\r\nname is written in a separate line of input data file and ended with\r\na control sign: '+' for delete\r\nor '-' for keep. Full file names are not repeated. The list comprises\r\nat least one file, and at least one\r\nfile is marked to be deleted. There are no more than 250 files.OutputFor each dataset, write to the first line of output the maximum number of files one DEL command can delete.ExampleInput:2\r\n\r\nBP +\r\nBPC +\r\nTURBO -\r\n\r\nEXCHANGE +\r\nEXT +\r\nHARDWARE +\r\nMOUSE –\r\nNETWORK –Output:2\r\n2Hint:For the two tests above, the corresponding DEL commands are DEL BP* and DEL EX*.LinkYou can try problemDELCOMMfirst. It's far easier than this problem.",
