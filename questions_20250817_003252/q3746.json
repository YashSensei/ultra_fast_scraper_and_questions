  "text": "Two girls - Ivica and Marica - play an interesting game.First, they randomly choose a natural number N. They also define M = 1.Ivica plays first, then Marica, then Ivica, then Marica and so on.In each move, a girl has to increase M by 1 or multiply M by 2 (that is, M = M+1 or M = 2×M). The resulting numbermust not be greater than N.Theloserof the game is the girl who gets M = N. The other girl is, of course, the winner.Write a program to determine the winner, assuming that both girls play optimally.InputIn the first line there is an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 5), the number of games.T lines follow. In ithline there is an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1015), a chosen number for ithgame.OutputFor each of the T games print the name of the winner.ExampleInput:42345Output:MaricaIvicaMaricaMarica",
