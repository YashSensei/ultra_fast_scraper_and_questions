  "text": "Ada the Ladybug was playingchessagainst her good friend Velvet Mite Vinit. They were talking to each other during the game, saying \"I will take yourfigurein nextXmoves\". After the game, this was really bugging Ada so she have decided to give it more thinking.As she can't determine it \"that fast\", she asked you to make a program which could output the minimal number of moves in which two figures could get to each other (note they they don't have to alternate, so all the moves could be done only by one of the figures). Also note that it is classical8×8chessboard.The interesting figures will be:King, Knight, Queen, Tower, BishopInputThe first line of input will contain1 ≤ T ≤ 3*105, the number of test-cases.Each of the testcases will contain 6 integersf x y F X Y, where0 ≤ f, F ≤ 4are the types of figures (0 to 4 standing forKing, Knight, Queen, Tower, Bishopin this order) and0 ≤ x y X Y ≤ 7, the coordinates of given figures.OutputFor each test-case output the minimal number of moves get both figures to same \"box\". In case the figures can't meet, output \"INF\".Example Input5\r\n1 0 0 1 7 7\r\n2 1 3 3 2 5 \r\n0 1 0 4 5 5\r\n3 1 1 4 3 3\r\n0 1 2 0 3 4Example Output6\r\n2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n2Example Input10\r\n2 3 6 1 6 2\r\n3 3 6 3 6 7\r\n4 4 6 4 2 4\r\n3 6 0 4 1 0\r\n3 7 1 3 5 2\r\n0 0 6 1 5 4\r\n0 5 7 3 3 5\r\n0 4 1 4 5 3\r\n3 2 1 3 4 2\r\n0 5 2 0 2 7Example Output2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n2\r\n2\r\n2\r\n5",
