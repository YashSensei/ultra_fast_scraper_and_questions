  "text": "In number theory there is a very deep unsolved conjecture of the Hungarian Paul Erdős (1913-1996), that there exist infinitely many primes of the formx2+1, wherexis an integer. However, a weaker form of this conjecture has been proved: there are infinitely many primes of the formx2+y4. You don't need to prove this, it is only your task to find the number of (positive) primes not larger thannwhich are of the formx2+y4(wherexandyare integers).InputAn integerT, denoting the number of testcases (T≤10000). Each of theTfollowing lines contains a positive integern, wheren<10000000.OutputOutput the answer for eachn.ExampleInput:4\r\n1\r\n2\r\n10\r\n9999999Output:0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n13175",
