  "text": "Sam and Dean fight the supernatural creatures to protect the humans. Now they have come across a creature called the Vedala, which are always found in pairs. Each Vedala can be represented by a polynomial. Both the Vedalas need to be killed at once or else they can't be killed. They can be killed only by using the product of the two polynomials representing the two Vedala. Help Sam and Dean find the product of the polynomials fast, so they can do their work.InputFirst line contains an integerT (≤ 10), number of test cases.Each test case will haven (n ≤ 10000), maximum degree of the polynomials on the first line.Next two lines will have n+1 space separated integers each representing the coefficients of first and second polynomials respectively.All input coefficients values are≤ 1000.OutputFor each test case output a line of 2n space separated integers indicating coefficients of the polynomial created after multiplication.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n1 2 3\r\n3 2 1\r\n2\r\n1 0 1\r\n2 1 0Output:3 8 14 8 3\r\n2 1 2 1 0Explanation1st test case n=2, the polynomials are x2+ 2x + 3 and 3x2+ 2x + 1.On multiplying we get 3x4+ 8x3+ 14x2+ 8x + 3 and hence the answer is 3 8 14 8 3.2nd test case n=2, the polynomials are x2+ 1 and 2x2+ x.On multiplying we get 2x4+ x3+ 2x2+ x and hence the answer is 2 1 2 1 0.",
