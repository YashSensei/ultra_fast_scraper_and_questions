  "text": "A string is finite sequence of          characters over a non-empty finite set Σ.In this problem, Σ is the set of         lowercase letters.Substring, also called factor, is a consecutive         sequence of          characters occurrences at least once in a string.Now your task is a bit        harder, for some given strings, find the length of the longest common substring         of them.Here common substring means a substring of all the considered strings.InputThe input contains at most 10 lines, each line consists of no more than 100000 lowercase letters, representing a        string.OutputThe length of the longest common substring. If such string doesn't exist,  print \"0\" instead.ExampleInput:alsdfkjfjkdsal\r\nfdjskalajfkdsla\r\naaaajfaaaaOutput:2Notice: new testcases added",
