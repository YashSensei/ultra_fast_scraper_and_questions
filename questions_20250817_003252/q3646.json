There are two friends living in different cities who wish to collect some ingredients available at different stores to make cake. There are s such stores. They need not come back home after purchasing the ingredients. Petrol is expensive and they would hence like to travel minimum total distance (sum of distance distance travelled by both kids). Help them find out what this distance is.Inputn m(mlines of the formaibici)Herenis number of cities,mis number of roads,aiandbiare the cities (0 indexed) the roads connect andciis the length of this roadswheresis the number of stores(1 line containingsspace separated integers indicating the city number in which the stores are located.)(two space separated integers indicating the cities in which the two kids live)OutputSingle integerxwherexis the minimum distance that the duo will travel that is minimum sum of distance travelled by first kid and second kid.Constraints:2 ≤ n ≤ 1001 ≤ m ≤ (n × (n - 1)) / 20 ≤ a, b < n0 ≤ c ≤ 10001 ≤ s ≤ 8SampleInput:5 6\r\n0 1 5\r\n1 4 1\r\n0 4 10\r\n0 2 2\r\n1 2 3\r\n2 3 4\r\n2\r\n2 4\r\n0 1Output:3Problem Setter: Vidit Gupta",
