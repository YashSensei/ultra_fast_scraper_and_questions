Find the most occurring word in the book with S as prefix.InputThe first line consists of an integer n, the number of words in the text book. The next n lines consists of the words in the book. The next line consists of an integer q, the number of queries. Next q lines consists a string S.OutputFor each query String S, print the most occurring word in the book with S as prefix along with the number of occurrences of that word.If there are many such words, print the lexicographically smallest word. If there is no such word, print -1.Constraints1 ≤ n ≤ 5×1051 ≤ q ≤ 1051 ≤ word length ≤ 10All the characters in the word are lowercase letters of the English alphabet.SampleInput10\r\napple\r\nbanana\r\norange\r\napplet\r\nbanana\r\noriental\r\norange\r\noriental\r\napplet\r\nbangalore\r\n8\r\nban\r\nbang\r\napp\r\nor\r\noriental\r\napple\r\nhobbits\r\norangesOutputbanana 2\r\nbangalore 1\r\napplet 2\r\norange 2\r\noriental 2\r\napplet 2\r\n-1\r\n-1Problem source: Inspired from autocomplete feature on Google keyboard.",
