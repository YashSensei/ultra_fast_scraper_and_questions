  "text": "The problem is simple - find(ab) % MOD, where:a = Nthnon-Fibonaccinumber.b = (NthFibonaccinumber) % MOD.MOD = 109+7.Consider Fibonacci series as 1, 1, 2, 3 ...Note: It is guaranteed that Nth non-Fibonacci number will always be less than MOD value for every value of N used.InputFirst line containsT, the number of test cases.Each next T lines contains a numberN.OutputPrint T lines of output where each line corresponds to the required answer.Announcement:Constraints are updated. Sorry for inconvenience occurred.ExampleInput:3\r\n3\r\n2\r\n1Output:49\r\n6\r\n4ExplanationFor N=3 : 3rd non Fibonacci number = 7, 3rd Fibonacci number = 2. answer = 72% MOD = 49For N=2 : 2nd non Fibonacci number = 6, 2nd Fibonacci number = 1. answer = 61% MOD = 6For N=1 : 1st non Fibonacci number = 4, 1st Fibonacci number = 1.  answer = 41% MOD = 4Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1000001 ≤ N ≤ 9×108Note: Test cases have been updated and constraints are changed. Those who get TLE or WA are suggested to resubmit. GOOD LUCK there.",
