  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is a well known mathematician. Next week she is going to represent her school in Mathematic Olympiad. There are many schools participating and each of them has many students. Anyway only some of the students and only some of the schools will be available to participate in the Olympiad. Question is, how many combinations of students can participate in the Olympiad?More specifically: There areNschools from which exactlyAwill participate. Moreover there areBstudents in each school and exactlyDof them will participate in the Olympiad.Ada could count it herself. But this process takes too much time and the limits for schools and students are changing every moment so she has decided to make a program for it (in fact she has decided that you will make the program for her)!InputThe input contains up to104lines, each containing four integersN,A,B,D,1 ≤ A ≤ N ≤ 106,1 ≤ D ≤ B ≤ 106OutputFor each line print the number of combination of students, which can participate in the Olympiad. All students and universities are distinguishable, but their order doesn't matter.Since the answer might be huge, print it modulo109+7(1000000007)Example Input2 1 2 2\r\n2 2 2 1\r\n2 1 2 1\r\n4 3 3 2\r\n4 2 1 1\r\n10 4 12 7\r\n50 30 44 20Example Output2\r\n4\r\n4\r\n108\r\n6\r\n625817778\r\n154746653",
