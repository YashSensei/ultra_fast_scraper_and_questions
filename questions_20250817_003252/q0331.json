  "text": "We say that two triangles intersect if their interiors have at least one common point. A polygon is called convex if every segment connecting any two of its points is contained in this polygon. A triangle whose vertices are also vertices of a convex polygon is called an elementary triangle of this polygon. A triangulation of a convex polygon is a set of elementary triangles of this polygon, such that no two triangles from the set intersect and a union of all triangles covers the polygon. We are given a polygon and its triangulation. What is the maximal number of triangles in this triangulation that can be intersected by an elementary triangle of this polygon?ExampleConsider the following triangulation:The elementary triangle (1,3,5) intersects all the triangles in this triangulation.TaskWrite a program that for each test case:reads the number of vertices of a polygon and its triangulation;computes the maximal number of triangles intersected by an elementary triangle of the given polygon;writes the result to standard output.InputThe number of test casestis in the first line of input, thenttest cases follow separated by an empty lineIn the first line of a test case there is a numbern, 3 <=n<= 1000, which equals the number of vertices of the polygon. The vertices of the polygon are numbered from 0 ton-1 clockwise. The followingn-2 lines describe the triangles in the triangulation. There are three integers separated by single spaces in the (i+1)-st line, where 1 <=i<=n-2. These are the numbers of the vertices of thei-th triangle in the triangulation.OutputFor each test case your program should produce one line with exactly one integer - the maximal number of triangles in the triangulation, that can be intersected by a single elementary triangle of the input polygon.ExampleSample input:1\r\n6\r\n0 1 2\r\n2 4 3\r\n0 5 4\r\n2 4 0Sample output:4",
