NextTlines contains a single integerN.OutputPrint theminimumvalue ofMin single line for each test case.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1061 ≤ N ≤ 1018ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n2Output:3\r\n6ExplanationFor N = 1, F(N) = 34 + 30 + 32 = 96. So, M = 3, now C(N) = 99 mod11 = 0.For N = 2, F(N) = 1156 + 60 + 32 = 1248. So, M = 6, now C(N) = 1254 mod11 = 0Problem Credits : IIIT Allahabad HE Club",
