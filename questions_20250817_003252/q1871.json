  "text": "There is a number of disjoint vertical line segments in the plane. We say that \r\n\ttwo segments are horizontally visible if they can be connected by a horizontal \r\n\tline segment that does not have any common points with other vertical segments. \r\n\tThree different vertical segments are said to form a triangle of segments if \r\n\teach two of them are horizontally visible. How many triangles can be found in a \r\n\tgiven set of vertical segments?TaskWrite a program that:reads the description of a set of vertical segments,computes the number of triangles in this set,writes the result.InputThe first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to \r\n\tthe number of data sets, 1 ≤ d ≤ 20. The data sets follow.The first line of each data set contains exactly one integer n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 8000, equal to the number of vertical line segments.Each of the following n lines consists of exactly 3 nonnegative integers \r\n\tseparated by single spaces: y'i, y''i, xi(that \r\n\tis the y-coordinate of the beginning of a segment, y-coordinate of its end and \r\n\tits x-coordinate, respectively). The coordinates satisfy: 0 ≤ y'i< \r\n\ty''i≤ 8000, 0 ≤ xi≤ 8000. The segments are \r\n\tdisjoint.OutputThe output should consist of exactly d lines, one line for each data set. Line \r\n\ti should contain exactly one integer equal to the number of triangles in the \r\n\ti-th data set.ExampleSample input:1 \r\n5 \r\n0 4 4 \r\n0 3 1 \r\n3 4 2 \r\n0 2 2 \r\n0 2 3Sample output:1",
