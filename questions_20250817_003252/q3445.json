He/she will answer exactly one of them correctly and one of them incorrectly, you don't know which\r\nis a correct answer and which is an incorrect one. Given their answers, determine the number of combinations of answers to themquestions that can still be correct (i.e., no contradictions).InputFirst line is the number of inputs.\r\nFor each set of input, start out with a line ofn ≤ 10000andm ≤ 200, followed bynlines.\r\nThe i-th line has four integersa b c d. It means that the answer given by the i-th person for question a is b, and for question c is d.\r\nMoreover, the answer \"1\" means yes, and \"0\" means no.OutputFor each line of input, output \"No Inference\" if the answers do not help you eliminate any wrong combination\r\nof answers or the number of combinations of possible answers is 0, otherwise output the size of the set of combinations of answers still possible.SampleInput2\r\n2 2\r\n1 1 2 0\r\n1 1 2 1\r\n4 4\r\n1 1 2 1\r\n1 1 3 0\r\n2 1 4 1\r\n3 1 4 0OutputNo Inference\r\n2Problem setter – sy",
