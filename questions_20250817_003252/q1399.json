Given n and the inversion\r\nnumber m, your task is to ﬁnd the smallest permutation of the set { 1, 2 ... n } , \r\nwhose inversion number is exactly m. A permutation a1, a2 ... an is smaller \r\nthan b1, b2 ... bn if and only if there exists an integer k such that aj = bj \r\nfor 1 ≤ j < k but ak < bk.InputThe input consists of several test cases. Each line of the input contains two\r\nintegers n and m. Both of the integers at the last line of the input is −1,\r\nwhich should not be processed. You may assume that\r\n1 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 1/2n(n − 1).OutputFor each test case, print a line containing the smallest permutation as \r\ndescribed above, separates the numbers by single spaces.SampleInput5 9\r\n7 3\r\n-1 -1Output4 5 3 2 1\r\n1 2 3 4 7 6 5",
