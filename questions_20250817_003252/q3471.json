  "text": "You might have heard of the Fibonacci numbers and of the numberpi. If you let these two ideas\r\nmerge, a new and esoteric concept comes into being:the Pibonacci numbers. These can be defined for\r\nrealx ≥ 0by:P(x) = 1for0 ≤ x < 4P(x) = P(x-1) + P(x-pi)for4 ≤ x,wherepi = 3.1415926535...In this problem, you are asked to computeP(x)for a givenx.InputThe input file contains several non-negative integer numbers (less than 30000) each on a separate\r\nline. The last line contains -1 marking the end of the input file.OutputFor each non-negative real number in the input file, output the corresponding\r\nPibonacci number. If the Pibonacci number be more than 50 digits long,\r\ndivide it on the consecutive lines, outputting 50 digits on each\r\n(the last line may contain less digits).ExampleInput:0\r\n4\r\n11\r\n-1Output:1\r\n2\r\n20",
