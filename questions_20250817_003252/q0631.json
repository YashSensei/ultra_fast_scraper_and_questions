  "text": "Each palindrome can be always created from the other palindromes, if a single character is also a palindrome. For example, the string \"malayalam\" can be created by some ways:malayalam = m  + ala + y + ala + mmalayalam = m + a + l + aya + l + a + mWe want to take the value of function NumPal(s) which is the number of different palindromes that can be created using the string S by the above method. If the same palindrome occurs more than once then all of them should be counted separately.InputThe string S.OutputThe value of function NumPal(s).Limitations0 < |s| â‰¤ 1000ExampleInput:malayalamOutput:15",
