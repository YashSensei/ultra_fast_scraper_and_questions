  "text": "Farmer John is making the difficult transition from raising mountain\r\ngoats to raising cows.  His farm, while ideal for mountain goats,\r\nis far too mountainous for cattle and thus needs to be flattened\r\nout a bit. Since flattening is an expensive operation, he wants to\r\nremove the smallest amount of earth possible.The farm is long and narrow and is described in a sort of two-dimensional\r\nprofile by a single array of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) integer elevations\r\n(range 1..1,000,000) like this:1 2 3 3 3 2 1 3 2 2 1 2,which represents the farm's elevations in profile, depicted below\r\nwith asterisks indicating the heights:* * *     *\r\n  * * * * *   * * *   *\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n1 2 3 3 3 2 1 3 2 2 1 2A contiguous range of one or more equal elevations in this array\r\nis a \"peak\" if both the left and right hand sides of the range are\r\neither the boundary of the array or an element that is lower in\r\nelevation than the peak. The example above has three peaks.Determine the minimum volume of earth (each unit elevation reduction\r\ncounts as one unit of volume) that must be removed so that the\r\nresulting landscape has no more than K (1 ≤ K ≤ 25) peaks.  Note\r\nwell that elevations can be reduced but can never be increased.If the example above is to be reduced to 1 peak, the optimal solution\r\nis to remove 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 units of earth to obtain this set\r\nof elevations:* * *     -\r\n  * * * * *   - - -   -\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n1 2 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 1where '-'s indicate removed earth.InputThe first line of the input contains integer t representing the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and KLines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single integer elevation. Line\r\n        i+1 contains the elevation for index i.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum volume of earth that must be removed to reduce\r\n        the number of peaks to K.ExampleInput:1\r\n12 1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n3\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n2Output:5Input detailsThis is the example used above.",
