  "text": "Ada the Ladybug has just bought a few servers. She is not a programming bug so she needs a server administrator to set everything for her. Yay, she have chosen you to help her. Your first job is simple - the servers are (somehow) connected with wires and you have to find out the number of components they form.Easy isn't it? Well sadly the servers are raw and nothing is (can be) installed on them (at the moment), so you can only usebash.InputThe first line of input contains1 ≤ N ≤ 600, 0 ≤ M ≤     600, the number of servers and the number of wires between them.  The nextMlines contains two integers0 ≤ a, b < N, the servers which are connected by wires.OutputPrint the number of connected components.Example Input6 3\r\n1 2\r\n3 4\r\n5 0Example Output3Example Input 211 9\r\n0 10\r\n1 6\r\n1 8\r\n2 7\r\n2 8\r\n3 4\r\n3 6\r\n4 7\r\n4 10Example Output 23Example Input 35 2\r\n0 4\r\n1 4Example Output 33Example Input 45 1\r\n1 2Example Output 44Example Input 54 2\r\n1 3\r\n0 2Example Output 52",
