  "text": "Given the length of side a of a triangle and the distances from the centroid (the point of concurrence of the medians - red in the picture) to all sides: a, b and c, calculate this triangle's area and the distance (blue line) from the orthocenter (the point of concurrence of the heights - green in the picture) to the centroid.InputIn the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). The next n lines - 4 floating point values: the length of side a, and distances from the centroid to sides a, b and c.Outputn lines consisting of 2 floating point values with 3 digits after the decimal point: the area of the triangle and the distance from the orthocenter to centroid.ExampleInput:2\r\n3.0 0.8660254038 0.8660254038 0.8660254038\r\n657.8256599140 151.6154399062 213.5392629932 139.4878846649Output:3.897 0.000\r\n149604.790 150.275",
