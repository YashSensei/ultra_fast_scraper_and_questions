If you find more than one solution, output the lexicographically smallest.InputThe first and only line of input contains a string s (consisting only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet). The length of s is less than or equal to 105.OutputTo the first line of output print the length of the string x. To the second line print the string x.Such a string will always exist in the test data.ExampleInput:abcabcOutput:3abc",
