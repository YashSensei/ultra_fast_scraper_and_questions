She wants to find a new name, which will contain the original name at leastKtimes as substring (to emphasize its importance). As Ada doesn't want the pet's name to be too long, she wants to find the shortest one - can you find the length of it?InputThe first line of input will containT, the number of test-cases.Each of the nextTlines will contain a non-empty strings, consisting of lowercase English letters and a number1 ≤ K ≤ 106(the number of times the given name shall be in the new name).The sum of lengths of strings over all test-cases will not exceed5*105.OutputFor each test-case print the minimum length of new name.Example Input8\r\nada 3\r\nabc 2\r\nr 7\r\nrr 5\r\ngorego 3\r\nabbababbbbababababba 2\r\nabcabcabca 3\r\nlopadotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimhypotrimmatosilphioparaomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephalliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon 1Example Output7\r\n6\r\n7\r\n6\r\n14\r\n36\r\n16\r\n182",
