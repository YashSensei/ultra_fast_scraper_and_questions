  "text": "In this problem, a string only consists of lowercase letters.Substring, is a consecutive sequence of characters occurrences at least once in a string.Common substring means a substring of two strings.After getting TLE on LCS and LCS2, lqp18_31 felt really depressed. So he came up with an interesting idea. He want to modify the definition of LCS and call it ELCS.ELCS: for two given strings s1[0..n-1] and s2[0..m-1], the ELCS of them is a string p[0..k-1] k ≤ min(n, m) so that s1[i] = s2[i] = p[i] (for 0 ≤ i < k) and s1[k] ≠ s2[k] or k == n or k == m.Now your task is easy.You are given N strings and Q queries.Each query consists two integers a and b. You must answer the length of the ELCS of the a-th string and b-th string.InputFirst line consists one integer N.Next N lines consist N strings.Next line consists one integer Q.Next Q lines consist two integers a and b. (0 ≤ a, b < N)30% of the test data: N ≤ 100 Q ≤ 10000, length(string[i]) ≤ 100100% of the test data: the number of total characters ≤ 500000, N ≤ 100000, Q ≤ 100000.OutputQ lines. Each line consists the length of the ELCS of the a-th string and b-th string.ExampleInput:5\r\ndy\r\nljq\r\nlqp\r\nws\r\njzt\r\n3\r\n0 1\r\n1 2\r\n0 2Output:0\r\n1\r\n0",
