  "text": "Vieri Corp, a technology company, has requested Bima, a constructor, to build an isosceles triangle on their brand new field. On each vertex of the triangle, they requested a poleA, BandCwhereAB=BC.It is guaranteed that B is the shortest pole. They also requested a rope of lengthxandyto connect the tip of the polesABandBCrespectively. Given the height of poleA,C and the length of ropexandyhelp Bima calculate the the height of poleB.You should minimize B. I've decreased the constraints so don't worry about precision error :) It is guaranteed that there will be an answer. The ropes cannot be loose. The pole's diameter is negligible.Refer to the image below for better understanding.InputA C x yOutputThe height of poleBcorrect to 3 decimal places.ExamplesInput 1:10 20 10 18.973665961Output 1:2.000000Input 2:10 7 8.5 6.0207972894Output 2:2.500Constraints1 ≤ A ≤ 5000001 ≤ C ≤ 5000001 ≤ x ≤ 5000001 ≤ y ≤ 500000",
