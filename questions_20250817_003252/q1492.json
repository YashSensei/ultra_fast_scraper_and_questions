  "text": "After a long period working in his magical garden, Bratan Mahammad could grow flowers ofNdistinct kinds there. Since Tukezban's (Mahammad's love) birthday is coming, as a perfect gift, Mahammad wants to give her K bunches of flowers. Interestingly, each flower has a beautifulness xiand the number of flowers of every kind isM. When preparing flower buckets, he has to be very careful: every bucket must consist ofNflowers and surely, all flowers have to be distinct kind in each bucket. The overall beauty value ofKbuckets depends on the absolute difference between the beautifulness of the most beautiful flower of K buckets (max(xi)) and the least beautiful one (min(xi)). Help Mahammad minimize this difference.InputThe first line of the input contains 3 positive integers,N,MandK, denoting the number of flower types, the number of flowers in each type, and the number of buckets needed, respectively. Then, the following N lines have 4 integers each,xi,1,ai,bi,ci.Herexi,1indicates the beautifulness of the first flower in i-th type. And for remaining M - 1 flowers, beautifulness value is calculated asxi, j= (ai* xi, j-1+ bi) % ci.You can safely assume thatN, M, K ≤ 2500andK≤ M.All numbers in input section fit 32-bit signed non-negative integers.OutputPrint theminimum possible difference in K-buckets.ExampleInput:2 3 2\r\n2 2 3 9\r\n2 1 2 10Output:4Note:The generated beauty values will be:For i = 1: (2, 7, 8)For i = 2: (2, 4, 6)One optimal way is to choose buckets as (7, 4) and (8, 6) together, so the difference is |8 - 4| = 4By the way, we should not choose (2, 4) and (7, 2), since |7 - 2| = 5, which is greater than 4.",
