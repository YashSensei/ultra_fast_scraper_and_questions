  "text": "The Stirling number of the second kind S(n, m) stands for the number of ways to\r\n\tpartition a set of n things into m nonempty subsets. For example, there are\r\n\tseven ways to split a four-element set into two parts: {1, 2, 3} u {4}, {1, 2,\r\n\t4} u {3}, {1, 3, 4} u {2}, {2, 3, 4} u {1}, {1, 2} u {3, 4}, {1, 3} u {2, 4},\r\n\t{1, 4} u {2, 3}.There is a recurrence which allows you to compute S(n, m) for all m and n.S(0, 0) = 1,S(n, 0) = 0, for n > 0,S(0, m) = 0, for m > 0,S(n, m) = m×S(n-1, m) + S(n-1, m-1), for n, m > 0.Your task is much \"easier\". Given integers n and m satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤\r\n\tn, compute the parity of S(n, m), i.e. S(n, m) mod 2.For instance, S(4, 2) mod 2 = 1.TaskWrite a program that:reads two positive integers n and m,computes S(n, m) mod 2,writes the result.InputThe first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to\r\n\tthe number of data sets, 1 ≤ d ≤ 200. The data sets follow.Line i + 1 contains the i-th data set - exactly two integers niand\r\n\tmiseparated by a single space, 1 ≤ mi≤ ni≤ 109.OutputThe output should consist of exactly d lines, one line for each data set. Line\r\n\ti, 1 ≤ i ≤ d, should contain 0 or 1, the value of S(ni, mi)\r\n\tmod 2.ExampleInput:1\r\n4 2Output:1",
