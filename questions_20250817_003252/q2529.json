  "text": "Do you ever become frustrated with television because you keep seeing the same things, recycled over and over again? Well I personally don't care about television, but I do sometimes feel that way about numbers.Let's say a pair of distinct positive integers (n, m) is recycled if you can obtain m by moving some digits from the back of n to the front without changing their order. For example, (12345, 34512) is a recycled pair since you can obtain 34512 by moving 345 from the end of 12345 to the front. Note that n and m must have the same number of digits in order to be a recycled pair. Neither n nor m can have leading zeros.Given integers A and B with the same number of digits and no leading zeros, how many distinct recycled pairs (n, m) are there with A ≤ n < m ≤ B?Limits1 ≤ T ≤ 55A and B have the same number of digits.1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 2000000.Are we sure about the output to Case #4?Yes, we're sure about the output to Case #4.InputThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing the integers A and B.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing \"Case #x: y\", where x is the case number (starting from 1), and y is the number of recycled pairs (n, m) with A ≤ n < m ≤ B.ExampleInput:4\r\n1 9\r\n10 40\r\n100 500\r\n1111 2222Output:Case #1: 0\r\nCase #2: 3\r\nCase #3: 156\r\nCase #4: 287",
