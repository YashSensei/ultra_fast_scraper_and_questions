For example, number 1334 contains three\r\ndifferent digits 1, 3 and 4.InputThe input consists of no more than 50 test cases. Each test case has only\r\none line, which contains a positive integer n (1 â‰¤ n < 65536). \r\nThere are no blank lines between cases. A line with a single 0 terminates the input.OutputFor each test case, you should output one line, which contains m. \r\nIf there are several possible results, you should output the smallest one.ExampleInput:7 \r\n15 \r\n16 \r\n101 \r\n0Output:7 \r\n555 \r\n16 \r\n1111",
