  "text": "Duck is playing \"Teleporters and Gems\". On a 1 xNmap, there may be multiple teleporters (or no) and at least one gem. At the beginning, Duck is standing at the most left position. He has to collect all the gems with the help of teleporters. Below are the rules:1. Moving 1 unit is counted as 1 move.2. When Duck reaches a teleporter, he can instantly reach any of the next 3 teleporters (eg. 1 to 2, 3 or 4 teleporter, but not 1 to 5, 6, 7 teleporter, and previous not allowed) by 3 moves; Or he can ignore that teleporter and keep moving to next cell which is counted as 1 move.Let '@' = Teleporter, '.' = empty cell, there are 4 teleporters: @.@..@@, if Duck is at position 0 (the 1st teleporter), then he can instantly reach 2nd, 3rd or 4th teleporter by 3 moves. But ignoring the 1st teleporter makes him reach 2nd teleporter by 2 moves.3. Duck has to collect all gems.4. Once he collects the last gem, the game ends and no more move needed.5. Duck can only move right.Can you help him find out the minimum number of moves in order to collect all gems?InputThe first line is the number of test casesT. (1 ≤ T ≤ 50)For each test case, there is a stringSconsisting of '.' (≥ 0), '@' (≥ 0) and '*' (≥ 1), representing empty cell, teleporter and gem. (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 104)OutputPrint one integer x where x is the minimum number of moves in order to collect all gems starting from the most left cell.ExampleInput:3\r\n.@@...@.@...@@..*@.@.*...@..\r\n....@...@@.**.@....@@@*@.\r\n.*....*@@@@*..@@*..@Output:14\r\n16\r\n16ExplanationBracket means cells that Duck will pass through and minimum number of moves to that cellCase 1: (.@@)...@.@...(@@..*@.@.*)...@.. = 0 1 2 -> 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14Case 2: (....@)...@(@.**.@)....@@(@*)@. = 0 1 2 3 4 -> 7 8 9 10 11 12 -> 15 16Case 3: (.*....*@)@@(@*..@@*)..@ = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -> 10 11 12 13 14 15 16",
