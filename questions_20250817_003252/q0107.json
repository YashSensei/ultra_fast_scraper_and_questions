  "text": "It is well known that rational numbers form a countable set. Hence the set of rational numbers in the open interval (0,1) also form a countable set.Here we enumerate the rationals in (0,1) in the following fashion. First, every rational is expressed in the lowest terms : ie, as p/q where p and q are positive integers with no common factor other than one. Then we sort the fractions in the ascending order of p+q. In case of a tie, the smaller fraction comes first.The first few terms in this enumeration are 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 1/5, 1/6, 2/5...Given a natural number N, find the numerator and denominator of the Nth term in the enumeration.InputThe first line of the input contains T (≤ 1000), the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer N (≤ 1011).OutputFor each value of N, output separated by space the numerator and denominator (in lowest terms) of the Nth fraction in the enumerationExampleInput:236Output:1 41 6",
