  "text": "Note: Some tricky test cases were added on Feb. 26th, 2013 and time limit has been changed. All the solutions have been rejudged and some \"Accepted\" ones got Wrong Answer / Time Limit Exceeded. However, this problem can still be solved by a simple and beautiful solution :)Ualter is a smart guy, and he loves mathematics and everything related to numbers. Recently his friend Matheus Pheverso showed him a group of H-numbers. Also, his friend told him that, in the Ancient Greek, there H-numbers would be used to create music. This group of numbers can be described in this way:For each integer N, a positive integer A is H-number with N only if: LCM(N, A) = N × ALCM is the Lowest Common Multiple between two numbers.Example 1: N = 20, H-numbers = {1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19}Example 2: N = 10, H-numbers = {1, 3, 7, 9}Ualter loves classical music mainly Pachelbel's compositions. In order to achieve his old dream, he's willing to make a version of Canon in D using only H-numbers to create notes. To solve that problem, he needs, for each number N, the number of H-numbers of N that are between 1 and M, inclusive.TaskYou're given an integer Q - the number of queries. Each query consists of two integer N and M. Your task is to find the number of H-numbers of N between 1 and M.InputIn the first line there's an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 105) representing the number of queries. In the next Q lines there are two numbers N, M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105, M < N).OutputYou have to print for each query an integer xi representing the number of H-numbers of N less or equal to M.SampleInput:3\r\n20 15\r\n7 3\r\n10 8Output:6\r\n3\r\n3",
