  "text": "A Non-Decreasing number is a number whose ith digit from the left is greater than or equal to the (i-1)th digit from the left.You are given four integers A, B, C and D. X is any  integer between A and B, inclusive, and Y is any integer between C and D,  inclusive. You must output the number of numbers formed by the  concatenation of X and Y which are Non-Decreasing, i.e. if we treat \"X\"  and \"Y\" as STRINGS, then \"Z\" = \"X\" + \"Y\" must represent a Non-Decreasing  number.Since this number can be very large, give your answer modulo 98765431.If the same number \"Z\" can be formed in various ways, it must be counted every time. See example for clarification.InputThe first line of the input contains t, the number of test cases. This is followed by t lines containing 4 positive integers each, which are the values of A, B, C, D.OutputYou must output t lines. Each line contains the answers for the quadruple (A, B, C, D) in the order they appear in input.ExampleInput:11 11 1 11Output:56ExplanationNote that the number \"111\" is counted twice. Once as \"11\" + \"1\" and again as \"1\" + \"11\".ConstraintsA, B, C, D are all positive integers having ≤ 1000 digitsA ≤ B; C <= D;Number of test cases t ≤ 1000",
