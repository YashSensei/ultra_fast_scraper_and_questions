  "text": "John is trying to learn the Fibonacci sequence. This is what he has learned so far. The first two terms of the sequence are f(1) = 0 and f(2) = 1.  The next term f(n) is then calculated by adding the previous two terms f(n-1) and f(n-2). Therefore:f(1) = 0f(2) = 1f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 0 = 1f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 1 + 1 = 2f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 2 + 1 = 3f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 3 + 2 = 5After calculating this for a while, John realized that the values are becoming too big. In order to keep the values small, John changed his algorithm. Instead of calculating f(n) = f(n-1)+f(n-2), he decided he will calculate f(n) = ( f(n-1)+f(n-2) ) % 105.Now John wants to do some research on his new modified Fibonacci sequence. He will give you an integer A (A ≤ 105) and an integer B (B ≤ 106). You have to output all the terms from f(A) to f(A+B) in ascending order (non-decreasing order). But printing so many numbers is too much of a hassle. So, if there are more than 100 terms in the output, then only print the first 100.InputThe first line contains an integerT(T≤ 100), which is the number of test cases.Each test case contains two positive integersAandBas mentioned before.OutputFor each test case, print case number (Check sample output) and then print the terms from f(A)  to f(A+B) in ascending order (non-decreasing order). If there are more than 100 terms in the output, then only print the first 100.ExampleInput:3\r\n1 3\r\n3 3\r\n100 1Output:Case 1: 0 1 1 2\r\nCase 2: 1 2 3 5\r\nCase 3: 15075 69026",
