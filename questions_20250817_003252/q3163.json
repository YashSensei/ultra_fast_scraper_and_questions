  "text": "Let N be a positive integer. In theory it is easy to decide if d(N) (the number of positive divisors of N including 1 and N) is prime or not. Your task is just a little bit harder: compute all N in [1,10^6] for which d(N)=p*q where p and q distinct primes.InputThere is no input for this problem.OutputTo make the problem less io related write out only every 9-th of them, one per line.Output:50\r\n99\r\n162\r\n...\r\n999524\r\n999728\r\n999927",
