  "text": "An Imp jumps on an infinite chessboard. Moves possible\r\nfor the Imp are described by two pairs of integers:\r\n(a, b) and (c, d) - from square (x, y) the Imp\r\ncan move to one of the squares: (x+a, y+b), (x-a, y-b),\r\n(x+c, y+d), (x-c, y-d). We want to know for which square\r\ndifferent from (0, 0) to which the Imp can jump from (0, 0)\r\n(possibly in many moves) the value |x|+|y| is the lowest.TaskWrite a program whichreads from standard input two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) of\r\nintegers, different from (0, 0), describing moves of the Imp,determines a pair of integers (x, y) different from (0, 0),\r\nfor which the Imp can jump (possibly in many moves) from square (0, 0)\r\nto square (x, y) and for which the value |x|+|y| is the lowest.writes out to standard output the value |x|+|y|.InputTen test cases. Each test consists of four numbers a, b, c, d in one line, separated\r\nby spaces.-100000 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 100000OutputFor every test case your program should write a single line with a number equal the lowest possible value |x|+|y|.ExampleInput:13 4 17 5\r\n[and 9 test cases more]Output:2\r\n[and 9 answers more]",
