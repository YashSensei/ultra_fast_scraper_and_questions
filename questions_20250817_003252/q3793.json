  "text": "You are currently studying the languageAjob(which means strange in English) from a renowned professor. The language has infinite number of letters in its alphabet (now you know, why it is called ajob).The professor taught youNwords, one by one. The number of letters in a word is equal to its place in the teaching order. Thus, the1stword taught by the professor has1letter,2ndword has2letters,3rdword has3letters ... theNthword hasNletters.All the letters within a word are distinct to each other.Now, you are handed an assignment. You have to choose any one of theNwords and form a subsequence from it. The length of the subsequence should beexactlyKless than the length of original word. For example, if the length of the chosen word isL, then the length of the subsequence should beL-K. If for any word,Lis smaller thanK(L < K), then you must not choose that word. Two subsequences are different to each other if, the lengths of them are different or they contain different characters in the same position.Find the number of ways you can complete the assignmentmodulo p(pwill always be aprime).InputThe first line containsT, the number of test cases. The nextTlines contain three space-separated integersN,Kandp.OutputFor each test case, print one integer in a single line, the number possible ways you can complete the assignment,modulo p.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1002 ≤ N ≤ 10180 < K < N2 ≤ p ≤ 105,pis aPrime.ExampleInput:82 1 22 1 55 3 135 2 36 5 117 6 36 5 76 5 5Output:13227202",
