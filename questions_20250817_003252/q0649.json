  "text": "DescriptionMarko is learning method of successive squaring so that he can calculate abmod m quickly. To give himself practice he wrote many tuples of a, b and m and went to school thinking that he will do it after school.After school he found that tuples he wrote are modified by his little sister. His sister converted each b into base 3. Marko wrote everything in base 10.Help Marko to do his exercise.InputFirst line of input contains a number T, number of test cases. Then T test cases follows each containing three numbers a (≤ 109), b and m (≤ 105) (a in base 10, b in base 3 and m in base 10). Number of digits in b will be less than 250.OutputOutput a number for each test case abmod m in base 10.SampleInput:2\r\n2 10 10\r\n3 21101 19Output:8\r\n3",
