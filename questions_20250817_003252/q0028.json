  "text": "FJ has purchased N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000) yummy treats for the cows who\r\nget money for giving vast amounts of milk. FJ sells one treat per\r\nday and wants to maximize the money he receives over a given period\r\ntime.\r\nThe treats are interesting for many reasons:The treats are numbered 1..N and stored sequentially in single\r\n    file in a long box that is open at both ends. On any day, FJ\r\n    can retrieve one treat from either end of his stash of treats.Like fine wines and delicious cheeses, the treats improve with\r\n    age and command greater prices.The treats are not uniform: some are better and have higher\r\n    intrinsic value. Treat i has value v(i) (1 <= v(i) <= 1000).Cows pay more for treats that have aged longer: a cow will\r\n    pay v(i)*a for a treat of age a.Given the values v(i) of each of the treats lined up in order of\r\nthe index i in their box, what is the greatest value FJ can receive\r\nfor them if he orders their sale optimally?The first treat is sold on day 1 and has age a=1. Each subsequent\r\nday increases the age by 1.InputLine 1: A single integer, NLines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the value of treat v(i)OutputThe maximum revenue FJ can achieve by selling the treatsExampleInput:5\r\n1\r\n3\r\n1\r\n5\r\n2Output:43",
