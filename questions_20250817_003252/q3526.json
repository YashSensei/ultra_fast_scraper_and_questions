  "text": "There's a tree, with each vertex assigned a number. For each query (a, b, c), you are asked whether there is a vertex on the path from a to b, which is assigned number c?InputThere are multiple cases, end by EOF.For each case, the first line contains n (n ≤ 100000) and m (m ≤ 200000), representing the number of vertexes (numbered from 1 to n) and the number of queries.Then n integers follows, representing the number assigned to the i-th vertex.Then n-1 lines, each of which contains a edge of the tree.Then m lines, each of which contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ c ≤ n), representing a query.OutputYou should output \"Find\" or \"NotFind\" for every query on one line.Output a blank line AFTER every case.ExampleInput:5 5\r\n1 2 3 4 5\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n3 4\r\n3 5\r\n2 3 4\r\n2 4 3\r\n2 4 5\r\n4 5 1\r\n4 5 3Output:NotFind\r\nFind\r\nNotFind\r\nNotFind\r\nFind",
