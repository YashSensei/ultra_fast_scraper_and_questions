The pots are arranged along in a line.One day, She decided to change their order under the condition that no two pots that were originally next to each other remain next to each other.TaskWrite a program that is given the number of pots, calculates the number of possible orders satisfying the conditionmodulo a given integer M.InputLine 1 contains the integerN, the number of flower pots.Line 2 contains the integerM.OutputA single line containing one integer between0andM-1(inclusive): the number of possible orders moduloM.Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 2,0002 ≤ M ≤ 1,000,000,000Number of test cases is 28.ExampleInput:5\r\n11Output:3ExplanationFor 5 pots, there are 14 orders satisfying Hanadi's condition, assuming the original order of pots was \"ABCDE\", then the 14 possible orders are:ACEBDADBECBDACEBDAECBECADCADBECAEBDCEADBCEBDADACEBDBEACDBECAEBDACECADB14 modulo 11 = 3, so the answer is 3.",
