  "text": "A forest of unrooted trees initially consists of N  (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) single-vertex trees. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.Your task is to maintain that forest and answer connectivity queries.All edges in the problem areundirected.You will receive the following queries, where (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N) :addA B : add an edge between  vertices  A and B, where initially there is no path between A and B.remA B : remove edge between  vertices  A and B, where initially there is an edge between A and B.connA B : printYESif there is a path between A and B andNOotherwise, where A and B are different.InputThe first line of input contains the number of initial single-vertex trees N and the number of queries M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100,000). The following M lines contain queries.OutputFor eachconnquery outputYESorNO. Pay attention to letter case.ExampleThis example will be the first test case.Input:5 11conn 1 5add 1 2add 1 3add 3 4add 5 4conn 1 5rem 4 5conn 1 5rem 3 4add 3 5conn 1 5Output:NOYESNOYES",
