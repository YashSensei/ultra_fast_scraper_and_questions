  "text": "Little Lovro likes to play games with words. During the last few weeks he realized that some words don't like each other.The words A and Bdon't likeeach other ifthe word A is lexicographically before the word B, butthe word B' is lexicographically before the word A', where X' stands for the word X reversed (if X = “kamen”, then X' = “nemak”). For example, the words “lova” and “novac” like each other, but the words “aron” and “sunce” don't like each other.Given some set of the words, we definethe degree of chaosof the set asthe number of pairsof different words thatdon'tlike each other.Write a program that, given a set of words, finds the chaos degree for the set.InputThe first line of input contains an integerN, 2 ≤N≤ 100 000.Each of the followingNlines contains one word – a sequence of at most 10 lowercase letters of the English alphabet ('a' – 'z'). There will be no two identical words in the set.OutputThe first and only line of output should contain a single integer – the chaos degree of the given set of words.Note: use 64-bit signed integer type (int64 in Pascal, long long in C/C++)ExamplesInput:2\r\nlopta\r\nkuglaOutput:0Input:4\r\nlova\r\nnovac\r\naron\r\nsunceOutput:3Input:14\r\nbranimir\r\nvladimir\r\ntom\r\nkruz \r\nbred \r\npit\r\nzemlja\r\nnije\r\nravna\r\nploca\r\nko\r\nje\r\nzapalio \r\nzitoOutput:48",
