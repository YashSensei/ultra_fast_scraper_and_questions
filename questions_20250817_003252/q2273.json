  "text": "There is a text consisting of N characters. At each step Mirko chooses two numbers A and B and then reverses the subsequence consisting of characters between indices A and B, inclusive. Indices are 1-based.Write a program that prints the final text after all operations are made.InputThe first line of input contains the initial text of length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2500000). It consists only of lowercase letters of the English alphabet.The second line contains integer M (1≤ M ≤ 2500), the number of steps.Each of the following M lines contain two integer A and B (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ N).OutputIn the first and only line output the final text.ExampleInput:lukakuka31 45 81 8Output:kukalukaInput:kukulelebodumepcele53 710 122 105 185 15Output:kubeeludomepcelluke",
