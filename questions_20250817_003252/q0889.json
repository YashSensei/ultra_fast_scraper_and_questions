  "text": "There are N cities in Flatland connected with M unidirectional roads. The cities are numbered from 1 to N. The Flat Circle of Flatland (FCF) wants to set up a new capital city for his kingdom. For security reasons,the capital must be reachable from all other citiesof Flatland. FCF needs the list ofallcandidate cities. You are the chief programmer at FACM (Flat Association for Computing Machinery) responsible for providing the list to FCF as soon as possible.InputThe first line of the input file contains two integers: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000 and 1 ≤ M ≤ 200,000. Each of the following M lines contains two integers 1 ≤ A, B ≤ N denoting a road from A to B.OutputThe output file contains an integer denoting the number of candidate cities followed by the list of candidate cities in increasing order.ExampleInput:4 4\r\n1 2\r\n3 2\r\n4 3\r\n2 1Output:2\r\n1 2",
