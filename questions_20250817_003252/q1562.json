  "text": "Great programmer “Tourist” is attending a coding test. In this test he is asked to solve an easy problem. The problem description is:There is an arrayaconsists ofnintegers and another nonnegative integerx. He need to find the number of pair (i, j) wherei ≠ jandai– aj= x.As it is very easy for him, he gave you this problem and start trying another hard problem. Can you solve this for him?InputInput starts with an integert (1 ≤ t ≤ 10),number of test case.Each case contains two integern (1 ≤ n ≤ 105),andx (0 ≤ x ≤ 109).Next line contains n separated integersai(1 ≤ ai≤ 109).OutputFor each case, print the case number and the number of pairs which meet the above condition.ExampleInput:2\r\n5 3\r\n5 1 4 2 3\r\n10 2\r\n12 17 19 13 17 11 17 12 15 14Output:Case 1: 2\r\nCase 2: 10",
