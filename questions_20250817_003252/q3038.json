  "text": "Ada the Ladybug has two string which she wants to give to her friends. As she doesn't want to distinguish between them, she wants to use only some common subsequence. Firstly she wanted to simply use the longest common subsequence but then she realized it wouldn't bekosher.She assigned a positive value to each letter. Now she wants to find the most expensive subsequence.InputThe first line of each test-case will contain two integers1 ≤ N, M ≤     2000, the length of each subsequence.The next line will contain26integers (1 ≤ Pi≤     105), the price of each letter.The next line will contain string of lengthNconsisting of lowercase English alphabet.The next line will contain string of lengthMconsisting of lowercase English alphabet.OutputFor each test-case, print the cost of the most expensive common subsequence.Example Input4 4\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\nabcd\r\ndbcaExample Output2Example Input3 3\r\n1 7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\nbaa\r\naabExample Output7Example Input4 5\r\n1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6\r\nzbbz\r\nbbzbbExample Output14Example Input3 3\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\r\nabc\r\ndefExample Output0",
