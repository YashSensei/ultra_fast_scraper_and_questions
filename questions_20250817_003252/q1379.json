  "text": "VietnameseEnglishPalindrome is a string that has the property of reading the same in either direction (left to right or right to left). You are to determine whether a given string can be expressed as a concatenation of palindromes of even length.Note: A string can be formed by concatenation of any number of even palindrome strings.InputFirst line containsT(T < 100), the number of test cases.Tlines follow, each containing the string corresponding to that particular test case.Note:There might be a new-line character (i.e. '\\r' in C++) at the end of each line. Be careful with your languages.OutputOutput consists ofTlines, one corresponding to each test case. You should outputYESif the string can be expressed as concatination of even length palindromes andNOotherwise.ExampleInput:3\nmadam\naA\naabbOutput:NO\nNO\nYESConstraintsLength of string â‰¤ 106",
