  "text": "Let num (> 0) be n (> 0) digit(s) positive integer. num is represented as N1N2N3N4...Nn-2Nn-1Nn, where Niis the ithdigit of num from left (0 < i < n+1). Digits of num are sorted in descending and ascending order respectively and this sorting generates two new positive integers numdscand numasc. The difference between the numbers is diffnum= numdsc- numasc, if diffnumis divisible by both 6 and 9, then we say that num is a magic number. Let sumdigitsbe defined as followingnumber = diffnumdo {\r\n        number = sum of digits of number\r\n    } while (number > 10)\r\n    sumdigits= numberInputFirst line of input is t (< 101), total number of test cases. Each test case has n (< 10001) as its first input and next n lines contains num (< 10100).OutputFor each test case, write exactly n lines containing two or three specifications without space:Yif num is magic number otherwiseN.Let sumdigits= c,ZERif c is 0 (zero),ONEif c is 1 (one) if c > 1,EPif c is even and prime,ENPif c is even but not prime,OPif c is odd and prime orONPif c is odd but not prime.Let diffnum= d, If num is not a magic number then printEQLif d is not divisible by both 6 and 9,LTNif d is not divisible by 6 only,GTNif d is not divisible by 9 only.ExampleInput:1\r\n2\r\n31\r\n100Output:YONP\r\nNONPLTN0 is divisible by 6 and 9 :)",
