  "text": "You are given n binary strings s1... sn, each of the same\r\nlength m.  Along with each siyou are given a bit bi.  You are\r\nalso given some nonnegative integer k and want to know whether there\r\nexists a subset S of {0, 1 ... m-1} of size at most k such\r\nthat for each i = 1, 2 ... n, the bit biis the XOR of the bits\r\nof siat the indices in S.  The siare 0-indexed strings.\r\nRecall that the XOR of a set of bits\r\nis 1 if the number of bits equal to 1 is odd, else the XOR is 0\r\n(in particular, the XOR of an empty set of bits is 0).\r\n\r\nFor example, if s1= 1010 and S = {0, 3}, then b1would be\r\n1 (the first bit of s1) XOR'd with 0 (the last bit of s1),\r\nwhich is 1.\r\n\r\nGiven n, k, and the strings s1... snand their\r\ncorresponding bi, find a set S of size at most k which produces\r\nthe given bi.  You should also detect when no such S exists.InputThe first line contains n and k, space-separated (1 ≤ n ≤\r\n64, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10).  n lines then follow, where the ith line\r\ncontains si, followed by a space, then bi.  In a given test case\r\nall strings siare of the same length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 50).  k\r\nwill not be bigger than m.OutputIf no set S of size at most k exists producing the given bi,\r\noutput -1 followed by a newline.  Otherwise, on the first line\r\noutput the size of a possible S.  If the size of that S is not\r\n0, on\r\nthe second line, output a space-separated list of the indices in S,\r\nfollowed by a newline.  If there exist multiple valid S to be\r\noutput, you can output any one of your choosing.ExampleInput:3 1\r\n111 1\r\n001 0\r\n011 1Output:1\r\n1",
