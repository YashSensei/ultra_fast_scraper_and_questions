  "text": "Maggu and Coder were playing a game with strings. In each turn of the game, Maggu gives Coder a string. Coder can replace m consecutive 'a' in the string by n consecutive 'b' any number of times. This way he has to create 2 strings, one of maximum possible length and one of minimum possible length.InputFirst line of input contains a single integer T : number of test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 100).For each test case there are exactly two lines.First line contains a string s (1 ≤ length(s) ≤ 105) containing letters only from 'a' to 'z'.Second line contains two space separated integers representing m and n respectively. (1 ≤ m, n ≤ 105).Sum of length(s) over all test cases is ≤ 106.OutputFor each test case, print in a single line containing two space separated integers representing minimum and maximum length of string s that Coder can obtain.ExampleInput:3abc1 2aa1 2aba1 1Output:3 42 43 3ExplanationFor the first test case, you can convert abc to abc (by not changing at all), bbbc (changing 'a' to 'bb'). minimum length of s is 3 and maximum length is 4.",
