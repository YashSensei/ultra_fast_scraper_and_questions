  "text": "Let S = {1, 2, 3 ... N}.For a given positive integer K, the function f : S → S is called \"pretty\" if, for every X in S, it holds thatf ( f ( f ( ... f ( X ) ... ) ) ) = X, where f is repeated exactly K times.How many pretty functions are there, modulo M?InputThree natural numbers N, K and M. It holds that 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 30 000 and M ≤ 109.OutputNumber of pretty functions modulo M.ExampleInput:2 11000Output:1Input:3 21000Output:4Explanation of the example input 2: there are four pretty functions, namely:f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 3;f(1) = 2, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 3;f(1) = 3, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1;f(1) = 1, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 2.",
