  "text": "Rama Rao is the topper of his branch. One of his friends was jealous of it. So, he poses a question to test Rama Rao and is as follows:For a givenn, find the number of even and odd numbers among the set,{nC0,nC1...nCn}.Rama Rao was having hard time solving it. He hopes you can help him.InputFirst line containst (1 ≤ t ≤ 105), the number of test cases. Next t lines contain one integer per line, denotingn (0 ≤ n ≤ 1012).OutputFor each test case, output two space separated integers specifying the number of even numbers and odd numbers respectively.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n4Output:0 4\r\n3 2Explanation:for 3, values are:1 3 3 1. All are odd. Hence0 4.for 4, values are:1 4 6 4 1. Hence3 2.",
