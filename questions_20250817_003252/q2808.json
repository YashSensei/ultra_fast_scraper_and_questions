  "text": "Subham and Dewang both are playing with numbers. Subham gives Dewang an array of numbers and asks him to tell the minimum possible last number of an increasing sequence of lengthL.Note:Check the sample I/O for more clarity.InputInput consists of number of test casesT. Each test case contains size of array i.e.N. Next line containsNspace separated elements of array.  Next line contains length of the increasing sequence i.e.L.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 ≤ N ≤ 1060 ≤ a[i] ≤ 106OutputYou have to print the minimum possible last number of a sequence and if their is no increasing sequence of lengthL, then print \"-1\" without the quotes.ExampleInput:1\r\n7\r\n9 7 2 5 4 11 12 \r\n3Output:11ExplanationIn sample input, possible increasing sequences of length  L = 3 are  (9, 11, 12), (7, 11, 12), (2, 5, 11), (2, 4, 11), (2, 5, 12), (2, 4, 12), (2, 11, 12), (5, 11, 12), (4, 11, 12) and the minimum last number is 11 for the sequences  (2, 5, 11) and (2, 4, 11). Hence, the answer is 11.",
