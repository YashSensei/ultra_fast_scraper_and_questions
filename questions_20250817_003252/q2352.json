  "text": "You are given N number a1, a2... aN. In asegment flip, you can pick a contiguous segment ai, ai+1... ajof these numbers, where i ≤ j and negate all the numbers in this segment.You are permitted at most K segment flip operations overall. Also, no 2 segments that you pick can overlap. That is, if you flip ai... ajand ak... althen either j < k or l < i.Your aim is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the resulting sequence by applying appropriate segment flip operations meeting these constraints.For instance, suppose the sequence is -5, 2, -3 and you are allowed a single segment flip. The best sum you can achieve is 6, by flipping all 3 numbers as a single segment to 5, -2, 3.InputThe first line contains 2 integers N and K. The next line contains N integers, the initial values of a1, a2... aN.OutputA single integer denoting the maximum possible sum of the final array.Constraints0 ≤ K ≤ N-10000 ≤ ai≤ 100001 ≤ N ≤ 100000ExampleInput:3 1\r\n-5 2 -3Output:6",
