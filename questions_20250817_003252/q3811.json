  "text": "Alia  has been assigned a homework by her maths teacher to find the  \"Handsome\" numbers. She is confused about these numbers, as we all know  that she is very \"intelligent\" :PSo she needs your help. Following is an exact line that her teacher  has given about Handsome numbers : \"Handsome number can be defined as a number such that sum of all the  proper divisors of handsome number with modulus to m, has to be a devil  number.  This Devil number is a number whose total number of proper divisors, is  a Fibonacci number (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 ...).\"Note: Alia's lucky number is 1, so she assumes 1 as a proper divisor always :PInputFirst line of input is t (number of test cases) then next each t lines will contain two integers n (number that is to be checked), m.OutputPrint in a each output line Case number and \"YES.\" if a number is a handsome number otherwise \"NO.\". (with a dot)Case_#i_:_YES.\r\n        Case_#j_:_NO.Here, '_' refers to a single space.Constraintst ≤ 1002 ≤ n ≤ 1091 ≤ m ≤ 108ExampleInput:2\r\n6 5\r\n100 45Output:Case #1 : YES.\r\nCase #2 : YES.ExplanationCase #1 : proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 i.e. sum = 6 , taking mod  with 5, i.e. 1. Now number of proper divisors of 1 is a Fibonacci number.",
