Each player has to enter theNrooms in an order.LetPbe the permutation of sizeNrepresenting the order of rooms Okayu enters, andQfor Korone.Korone doesn't want to be too far from Okayu, so they set up a plan as the following:Okayu will enter the rooms in numerical order. Formally,P = {1, 2, 3, ... N}.Korone will enter the rooms in a way such that|Pi- Qi| ≤ Kfor every1 ≤ i ≤ N.How many configurations can Korone enter the rooms? Since the answer can be large, print the answer modulo109+ 7.InputThe first and only line contains two integersNandK.OutputPrint an integer denoting the number of permutationsQsatisfying the conditions above in modulo109+ 7.SamplesInput 1:3 1Output 1:3Input 2:3 2Output 2:6ExplanationIn sample 1, the possible configurations are{1, 2, 3},{2, 1, 3}, and{1, 3, 2}.\r\nIn sample 2, all permutations are valid.Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 10001 ≤ K ≤ 5",
