  "text": "Scofield is excellent at math tables, so T-BAG decided to make things a bit more interesting. He gives two numbers A and B and merges the multiplication tables of A and B in sorted order (ascending order), removing the duplicates and thus creates Saratable of A and B (sounds interesting) and asks Scofield the Nth number in the Saratable.Given A, B and N, Help Scofield in finding the Nth number in the Saratable, else he will be put into Camp 22 (North Korea) by the security officer T-BAG.InputFirst line contains number of test cases T. Each test case contains three integers A, B and N.OutputFor each test case print the Nthnumber of the Saratable.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 3000001 ≤ A, B ≤ 10001 ≤ N ≤ 1000000000Input:4\r\n3 5 2\r\n3 5 3\r\n2 3 4\r\n2 3 6Output:5\r\n6\r\n6\r\n9",
