  "text": "A palindromic decimal integer reads the same forward and backward.\r\nFor example, the following numbers are palindromic.6, 55, 282, 5005, 78187, 904409, 3160613, 11111111Palindromic integers are plentiful. In fact, any integer not\r\ndivisible by 10 has an infinite number of multiples that are\r\npalindromic. (The standard representation of a nonzero multiple of 10\r\ncannot be palindromic since its reversal would have a leading 0.)Write a program to determine, for a given positive integer, how\r\nmany of its positive multiples are palindromes of a given length.InputThe first line of the input will specify an integer n indicating the\r\nnumber of problem instances to follow, one to a line.  Each of the\r\nensuing  n  lines will specify a pair of positive integers   m, s\r\nseparated by a single space, with \r\n1 <  m  < 1000,  s < 20.    (For m, s in this range, there are\r\nfewer than 232palindromes among the s-digit multiples of m.)  Each\r\nline will terminate with an end-of-line.OutputThe output should indicate  for each m, s, exactly how many s-digit\r\npositive palindromes are divisible by m, with one problem instance per\r\nline.ExampleInput:5\t\r\n3 1\t\r\n25 3\t\r\n12 4\t\r\n30 3\r\n81 6Output:3\r\n2\r\n7\r\n0\r\n0Explanation:There are three positive 1-digit multiples of\r\n3, namely, 3, 6, and 9; all 1-digit numbers are trivially palindromes.\r\nAmong the 3-digit palindromes, 525 and 575 are multiples of 25.  The\r\n4-digit multiples of 12 that are palindromes are 2112, 2772, 4224,\r\n4884, 6336, 6996, 8448.   There are no positive palindromic numbers\r\nending in 0 (since we do not allow leading 0's).  No 6-digit\r\npalindromes are divisible by 81.",
