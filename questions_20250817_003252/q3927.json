  "text": "In a badminton tournament, each ofnplayers play all the othern - 1players. Each game results in either a win, or a loss. Players then write down the names of those whom they defeated (say list 1) and also of those who they (players of list 1) defeated. For example, ifAbeatsBandBbeatsC, thenAwrites the names of bothBandC.Consider a game betweenA,B,C,D,E,F,GwhereAdefeatsB,C;BdefeatsE;CdefeatsF. ThenA's list will have (B,C,E,F) and will not includeG.Note: SayAdefeatsB,BdefeatsCandCdefeatsD.Dis not necessarily present inA's list, a player's list contains players of list1 and players defeated by those in list1 (immediatewin).In this problem, we represent players by integers from 1 ton(Both inclusive.)InputFirst line of input contains an integert(number of test cases), each test case starts with an integernfollowed bync2(i.e.n * (n - 1) / 2) lines (results of all matches) each containing two integersa,bseparated by a space which meansadefeatedb.OutputPrint a line for each test case containing two space separated integersp,qwherepis the player with maximum possible number of players in his list andqis that number (maximum possible number of players in a list).In case there are many players with maximum number of players in their list, print minimum of such possibilities ofp.Constraintst≤ 50,n≤ 250, 1 ≤a,b≤nExampleInput:1\r\n3\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n3 1Output:1 2My best: 0.53s with PyPy and 1.50s with Python 2.7.9.
