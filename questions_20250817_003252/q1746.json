  "text": "You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) withnnodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 ton. Each node has a color, white or black. All the nodes are black initially. We will ask you to perform some instructions of the following form:0 u: ask for how many nodes are connected tou, two nodes are connected if all the node on the path fromutov(inclusiveuandv) have the same color.1 u: toggle the color ofu(that is, from black to white, or from white to black).InputThe first line contains a numbernthat denotes the number of nodes in the tree (1 ≤n≤ 105). In each of the followingn-1lines, there will be two numbers (u,v) that describes an edge of the tree (1 ≤u,v≤n). The next line contains a numbermdenoting number of operations we are going to process (1 ≤m≤ 105). Each of the followingmlines describe an operation (t,u) as we mentioned above(0 ≤t≤ 1, 1 ≤u≤n).OutputFor each query operation, output the corresponding result.ExampleInput 1:5\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n1 5\r\n3\r\n0 1\r\n1 1\r\n0 1Output 1:5\r\n1Input 2:7\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n2 5\r\n3 6\r\n3 7\r\n4\r\n0 1\r\n1 1\r\n0 2\r\n0 3Output 2:7\r\n3\r\n3Warning: large input/output data, be careful with certain languages",
