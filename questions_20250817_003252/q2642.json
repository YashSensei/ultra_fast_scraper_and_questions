  "text": "PP numbers are prime numbers and palindromes in decimal notation at once. Your task is to findn-th PP number in ascending order. Then calculate product of its non-zero digits - let's call itm- and findm-th prime number in ascending order.InputIn the first line of input there is one positive integerZ(1 ≤Z≤ 1000) which states the number of test cases. FollowingZlines contain test cases.Each test case consists of one positive integern(1 ≤n≤ 113) which states the number of PP number to find.OutputFor each test case print in separate line two numbers:n-th PP number andm-th prime number.ExampleInput:3\r\n1\r\n5\r\n2Output:2 3\r\n11 2\r\n3 5",
