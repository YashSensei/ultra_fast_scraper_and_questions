  "text": "Dr. Charles Xavier is trying to check the correlation between the DNA samples of Magneto and Wolverine. Both the DNAs are of lengthN, and can be described by using all integers between1toNexactly once. The correlation between two DNAs is defined as the Longest Common Subsequence of both the DNAs.Help Dr. Xavier find the correlation between the two DNAs.InputFirst line of input contains number of test casesT. Each test case starts with an integerN, size of DNA. The next two lines containsNintegers each, first line depicting the sequence of Magneto's DNA and second line depicting Wolverine's DNA.OutputFor each test case print one integer, the correlation between the two DNAs.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n1 2\r\n2 1\r\n3\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 3 2Output:1\r\n2Constraints1 ≤T≤ 101 ≤N≤ 100000",
