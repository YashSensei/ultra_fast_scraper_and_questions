  "text": "We have two strings A and B which are permutations of the same set of characters. We need to change these strings to obtain two identical strings by performing the following operations:swap two consecutive characters of a stringswap the first and the last characters of a stringThe operation can be performed on either string. Return the minimum number of moves that we need in order to obtain two equal strings?Constraints1 < length(A) = length(B) â‰¤ 2,000All the input characters are between 'a' and 'z'The count of each distinct character in A is identical to the count of the same character in B.InputFirst line: String A.Second line: String B.OutputMinimum number of moves.ExampleInput:aab\r\nbaaOutput:1",
