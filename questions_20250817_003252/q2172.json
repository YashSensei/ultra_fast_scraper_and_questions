  "text": "You are given a sequence of numbers s, you are required to find 3 indices i, j, k, where i < j < k and (s[i] ≤ s[j] ≥ s[k] or s[i] ≥ s[j] ≤ s[k]) if there are many solutions you should find the one where |s[i]-s[j]| + |s[j]-s[k]| is maximized, if there are still many solutions you should find the one which comes earlier in order (i.e. i1, j1, k1, comes before i2, j2, k2, if i1 < i2, or if i1 = i2, and j1 < j2, or if i1 = i2, j1 = j2, and k1 < k2).InputThe problem will be tested on multiple test cases, the first line of the input contains an integer n representing the size of the sequence (3 ≤ n ≤ 106), then followed by n integers. All numbers in this sequence do not exceed 106in absolute value. The input is terminated by end of file.OutputFor each test case, output a line containing the 3 indices of the pattern i, j, k space separated. If there is no such pattern output -1 instead.SampleInput:7\r\n2 3 1 7 2 4 8\r\n5\r\n2 3 5 7 1Output:3 4 5\r\n1 4 5",
