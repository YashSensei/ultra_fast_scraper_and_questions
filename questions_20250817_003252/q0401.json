  "text": "Let's call a matrixA[3 × 3]Dinostratus if all its nine elements are different positive integer numbers and each its elementai,j(where 1 ≤i,j≤ 3) is a multiple of  its neighborsai-1,j,ai-1,j-1andai,j-1(if they exist). In other words the following conditions hold:ai,j=X·ai-1,jfor some positive integerX(ifi≥ 2)ai,j=Y·ai,j-1for some positive integerY(ifj≥ 2)ai,j=Z·ai-1,j-1for some positive integerZ(ifi,j≥ 2)For example the matrices1392618412363181982112641581478822910610100400050100020000100001000001000000are Dinostratus.

Given a base number, find out how many different Dinostratus matices exist. Two matricesAandBare different if there are such indexesi,jthatai,j≠bi,j.InputInput file consists of several test cases. Input file starts with a line containing an integerT(T≤ 500), which is the number of test cases. The nextTlines constain one base numberN(1 ≤N≤ 1000000).OutputFor each test case output a single line containing the number of different Dinostratus matrices corresponding to the base number. It is guaranteed that the answer is less than 263.ExampleInput:71101001000100001000001000000Output:00223822571107475718106889830NoteYou can try the problemDINONUMfirst.",
