  "text": "Pythagoras is credited, by tradition, for the first proof of the relationa2+b2=c2in any right angled triangle wherecis hypotenuse andaandbare thecatheti.We define a Pythagorean triple as a set of three positive integersa,b, andcwhich satisfy the above equation, i.e.,a2+b2=c2.{3, 4, 5} is the most common example of such a triple.InputThe first line of input contains an integerT, the number of test cases.Each of the nextTlines contains\r\ntwo integersN,M.OutputFor each test case, print on a single line the number of Pythagorean triplet{a, b, c}such thatN ≤ a, b, c ≤ M.ExampleInput:3\r\n1 5\r\n4 10\r\n10 100Output:1\r\n1\r\n45Constraints0 < T < 1000 < N < M0 < T × M < 1.21×108There are several input files.Time limit is ×20 my top speed with C language (1kB of code).For your information, my total best time is 0.59s for the 6 input files. (Edit 2017-02-11, after compiler changes).Warning, it could be hard with interpreted languages. You can try the quite similar tutorial problemPYTRIPbefore.InformationThis problem is part of theBubble Cup competitionqualification round (April 2014).@students: good luck. GNU_salutations.",
