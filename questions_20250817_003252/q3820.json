The second line contains a sequence composed of n integers a1, a2... an. For each of the ai's it holds that 0 ≤ ai≤ 109.OutputThe only line of output should hold one integer: the minimum number of terms of the sequence that need to be changed so that it becomes k-even.ExampleInput:8 3\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8Output:3Input:8 3\r\n2 4 2 4 2 4 2 4Output:0",
