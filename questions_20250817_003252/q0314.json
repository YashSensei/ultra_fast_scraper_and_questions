  "text": "You are given two short sequences of numbers, X and Y. Try to determine the\r\nminimum number of steps of transformation required to convert sequence X into\r\nsequence Y, or determine that such a conversion is impossible.In every step of transformation of a sequence, you are allowed to replace\r\nexactly one occurrence of one of its elements by a sequence of 2\r\nor 3 numbers inserted in its place, according to a rule specified in the input\r\nfile.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test\r\ncases follow.For each test case, the first line of input contains four integers - N, M, U, V\r\n(1 ≤ N, M ≤ 50). The next two lines of input contain sequences X and Y,\r\nconsisting of N and M integers respectively. The next U lines contain three\r\nintegers:a b ceach, signifying that integeracan be converted\r\nto the sequenceb cin one step of transformation. The next V-U lines\r\ncontain four integers:a b c deach, signifying that integeracan\r\nbe converted to the sequenceb c din one step of transformation. With\r\nthe exception of N and M, all integers provided at input are positive and do\r\nnot exceed 30.The format of one set of input data is illustrated below.N M U Vx1x2... xny1y2... yna1b1c1...aubucuau+1bu+1cu+1du+1...avbvcvdvOutputFor each test case output -1 if it is impossible to convert sequence X into\r\nsequence Y, or the minimum number of steps required to achieve this conversion\r\notherwise.ExampleInput:1\r\n3 10 2 3\r\n2 3 1\r\n2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1\r\n3 1 2\r\n3 3 3\r\n3 1 3 2Output:6",
