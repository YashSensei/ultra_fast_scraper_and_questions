  "text": "You are given two DNA sequences A and B. It is said that these two DNA sequences are related if there exists a non-decreasing sequence C of the same length, such that Ci= Aior Ci= Bi. Find if the given sequences are related.Input format:The first line contains an integer,T, the number of test cases.For each test case:The first line contains an integer,N, the length of the DNA sequence.The second line contains a sequence of space-separated integers describing speciesA.The third line contains a sequence of space-separated integers describing speciesB.Output FormatOn a new line for each test case, printYESif a non-decreasing sequence of the same length can be found orNOif it cannot.Constraints:1 ≤ T ≤ 51 ≤ N ≤ 1050 ≤ Ai, Bi≤ 1010Sample:Input:3\r\n3\r\n1 2 3\r\n4 4 4\r\n3\r\n3 2 1\r\n6 5 4\r\n2\r\n1 0\r\n10 2Output:YES\r\nNO\r\nYES",
