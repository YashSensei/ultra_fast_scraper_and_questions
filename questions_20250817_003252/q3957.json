  "text": "There are already some SPOJ problems related toPythagorean triples.  Here is another one: Given an  integer n, calculate the number p(n) of Pythagorean triples with at least one cathetus of length n.InputInput starts with a positive integer t ≤ 1000, the number of test cases.Each of the following t lines contains a positive integer n ≤ 1015.OutputFor every n print the value of p(n) in a single line.ExampleInput:3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6Output:1\r\n1\r\n1Explanation: The only Pythagorean triple that has a cathetus with length 4 is (3, 4, 5), so p(4)=1.Note: If you find the time limit too strict, you may first try thetutorial versionwith identical test data, but increased time limit. I also recommend to solve problemsWPC5AandCATHETENfirst.",
