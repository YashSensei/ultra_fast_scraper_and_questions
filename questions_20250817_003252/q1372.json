We need to find the two closest to A n-digit numbers (the\nfirst one – greater or equal to A, the other – strictly less than A),\nwith decimal writings containing all the digits of B in some order.\nFor example if A=3022 and B=1232, using B’s digits we can obtain\nthe following 4-digit numbers: 1223, 1232, 1322, 2123, 2132, 2213,\n2231, 2312, 2321, 3122, 3212 and 3221. The least number greater\nor equal to A obtained by B’s digits is 3122, and the biggest one,\nstrictly less then A is 2321. If A=1232 and B=3022, the possible numbers\nare 2023, 2032, 2203, 2230, 2302, 2320, 3022, 3202 and\n3220. The least number greater or equal to A obtained by B’s digits\nis 2023, and there is no number less than A.\nWrite a program closest to find these “closest to A” numbers for\ngiven A and B, or to determine that one of them does not exist.InputTwo lines are read from the standard input, each of them containing an\nn-digit positive integer with no leading zeroes, with A read from the\nfirst, and B read from the second line (1 ≤ n ≤ 60).OutputWrite to the standard output:Line 1: the least n-digit number with no leading zeroes,\nnot less than A, containing all the digits of B in some order.\nIf such number does not exist, the output should be 0.Line 2: the biggest n-digit number with no leading zeroes, less\nthan A, containing all the digits of B in some order. If such number\ndoes not exist, the output should be 0.SampleInput:3075\n6604\n3000203\n4562454Output:4066\n0\n4244556\n2655444Problem for kid - Please, think like kid.",
