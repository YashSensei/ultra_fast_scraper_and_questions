  "text": "In this problem you have to calculate the determinant of an N x N matrix whose entries are given bym[i][j] = gcd(i,j)k, 1 ≤ i,j ≤ N.Here gcd(i,j) denotes the greatest common divisor of i and j.As the determinant D can grow very large, you have to print D%1000003.InputFirst line of input consists of a single integer containing the number of test cases T ( equal to around 20), each of the following T lines contain two integers N and k where N is the size of the matrix and k is the exponent.1 ≤ N ≤ 10000001 ≤ k ≤ 109OutputOne line corresponding to each test case containing the determinant modulo 1000003 for the corresponding test case.ExampleInput:3\r\n4 2\r\n2 4\r\n4 3Output:288\r\n15\r\n10192Note: You may want to solveDETERfirst, in case you havent already solved it.",
