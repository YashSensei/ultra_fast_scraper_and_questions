There are also M small ships, each of them connecting one village from the left and one village from the right side (in both ways).You are to organize a film festival in four of these villages: two from the left and two from the right side. Each two of these four villages must be connected by a ship (directly) if they belong to opposite sides of the river.Help yourself to choose these four villages and first find out; in how many ways can you choose them?InputIn the first line there are integers N ≤ 1000 and M ≤ N2.In the next M lines there are two integers from the interval [1, N] representing the village from the left and the village from the right side connected by this ship.OutputPrint the required number of ways to choose villages for the festival.ExampleInput:3 51 11 21 32 22 3Output:1(the only possibility is to choose the villages 1, 2 from the left and 2, 3 from the right side)",
