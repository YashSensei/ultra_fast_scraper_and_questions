  "text": "Professor Hopper is researching the sexual behavior of a rare species of bugs. He assumes that\r\nthey feature two different genders and that they only interact with bugs of the opposite gender. In\r\nhis experiment, individual bugs and their interactions were easy to identify, because numbers were\r\nprinted on their backs.Given a list of bug interactions, decide whether the experiment supports his assumption of two\r\ngenders with no homosexual bugs or if it contains some bug interactions that falsify it.InputThe first line of the input contains the number of scenarios. Each scenario starts with one line\r\ngiving the number of bugs (at least one, and up to 2000) and the number of interactions (up to\r\n1000000) separated by a single space. In the following lines, each interaction is given in the form of\r\ntwo distinct bug numbers separated by a single space. Bugs are numbered consecutively starting\r\nfrom one.OutputThe output for every scenario is a line containing “Scenario #i:”, where i is the number of the\r\nscenario starting at 1, followed by one line saying either “No suspicious bugs found!” if the\r\nexperiment is consistent with his assumption about the bugs’ sexual behavior, or “Suspicious\r\nbugs found!” if Professor Hopper’s assumption is definitely wrong.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 3\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n1 3\r\n4 2\r\n1 2\r\n3 4Output:Scenario #1:\r\nSuspicious bugs found!\r\nScenario #2:\r\nNo suspicious bugs found!",
