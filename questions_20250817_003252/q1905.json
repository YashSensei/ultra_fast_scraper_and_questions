  "text": "Have you solvedFCTRLproblem?In this problem you need to do the same task (given positive integern< 10100you need to count number of zeroes at the end of the decimal number ofn!), seems easy(?) but this time only Brainf**k language allowed.InputFirst line of input there is an integerT≤ 1000 denoting number of test case.NextTlines containing an integern.Each line is terminated with newline character (ASCII:10)OutputFor each test case, output number of zeroes at the end of the decimal form of numbern!ExampleInput:6\r\n3\r\n60\r\n100\r\n1024\r\n23456\r\n8735373Output:0\r\n14\r\n24\r\n253\r\n5861\r\n2183837Other InfoInput: 100% random log-uniform.This problem is using custom judge, so you can see the detail after you get AC/WA.Judge output format is like this: (\"Code Length (Valid Command only)\")\"Cell Used\"(\"BF Command executed\").Click here to see my submission result for this problem.Judge output for my BF code is: (1340)501(392776170) meaning that my Valid BF commands = 1340 commands and My code using 501 BF cell and 392776170 commands executed.You can click (AC/WA) status for more detail.My code running time is 0.59s and using 1.6MB of memory.Time limit is ~16× my BF program speed.See also:Another problem added by Tjandra Satria Gunawan",
