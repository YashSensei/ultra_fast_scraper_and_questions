  "text": "Given two grids of characters, consists of characters from 'a' to 'z' only. we name two grids 'A' and 'B'.Now, we need to find the lexicographically largest triplet(Assuming that one such solution always exists.)Given that:f(A, i, j, k) = B, 0 ≤ j < k < n and 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 2 (where 'n × n' is the size of grids)(i.e. function 'f' operated on matrix 'A' with 'i', 'j' and 'k' parameters gives matrix 'B'.Description of function 'f'f(M, i, j, k) : function operated on matrix 'M' does following operations in the given order.Take rows from index '0' to 'i' of the given grid M and flip it, i.e.for (each column Ci) reverse (A[0..i][Ci])Take columns from index '0' to 'j' of the grid and flip it, i.e.for (each row Ri) reverse (A[Ri][0..j])Take columns from index 'k' to 'n-1' of the grid and flip it, i.e.for (each row Rj) reverse (A[Rj][k...n-1]Remove columns indexed '0' to 'j' and concatenate on the right of the grid in the same order, making new grid.InputFirst line contains one integer 'n' (n × n is size of grid)Following n lines (i.e. line numbers 2 to n+1) contains strings each of size 'n' for grid 'A'.Following n lines (i.e. line numbers n+2 to 2n+1) contains strings each of size 'n' for grid 'B'.Constraints5 ≤ n ≤ 1000String contains only lower case letters.OutputThree integers (space separated) in one line representing i, j and k respectively (lexicographically largest solution).ExampleInput:5\r\nooscz\r\nhkaea\r\nnnzth\r\nkhdlf\r\nrejtf\r\nfldhk\r\nhtznn\r\naeakh\r\nzcsoo\r\nftjerOutput:3 3 4",
