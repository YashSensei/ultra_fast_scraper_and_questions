  "text": "Given an integer sequence containing n elements (numbered from 1 to n), your task is to find the minimum value M so that we can find k + 1 integers 0 = p(0) < p(1) < p(2) < ... < p(k-1) < p(k) = n, such that for any i from 0 to k - 1, the sum of elements from  position p(i)+1 to position p(i+1) is not greater than M.InputThe first line of input contains the number of test cases nTest (1 ≤ nTest ≤ 10).Each test case contains:The first line contains n, k. (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 15000)Each of the next n lines contains an integer of the sequence with value range from -30000 to 30000.OutputFor each test case write the minimum number M in a separate line.ExampleInput:1\r\n9 4\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n3\r\n2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n1Output:5",
