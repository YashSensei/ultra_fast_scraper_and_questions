'Z').A K-rectangle of the board is a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the sides of the board, and contains exactly K different types of letter.For example, with this 4×3 board:CED\r\nCEB\r\nCBC\r\nDDAThe rectangle [(1,1), (2, 2)] is a 2-rectangle of the board because it contains 2 different letters: C and E.Given M, N, K and the M×N board. Determine how many K-rectangles there are in the board.InputThe first line contains 3 integers M, N and K. (1 ≤ M, N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ K ≤ 26)The following M lines, each contains N letters of the English alphabet ('A' .. 'Z')OutputWrite one integer - the number of K-rectangles in the given board.ExampleInput:4 3 3\r\nCED\r\nCEB\r\nCBC\r\nDDAOutput:12",
