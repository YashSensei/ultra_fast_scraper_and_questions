  "text": "In the Mines of Moria, the job of Gakrobera Silverborn the dwarf is to load minecarts withNstones. The stones are numbered, from 1 toN, and a given minecart can only be loaded with consecutive stones.Each stone has a weight between 1 kg and 1000 kg, which we assume to be an integer. The optimal load of a mine cart is 2000 kg. The score of a minecart loaded withWkg of stones is(W− 2000)2. After all stones have been loaded in minecarts, the total score is the sum of the score of each minecart. The lower the total score is, the better it is.To help Gakrobera, find the best possible way to load minecarts, given the weights of each stone from 1 toN.For example, given four stones of 700 kg, Gakrobera will prefer to load them all in a single minecart (total score8002= 640 000). But given four stones of 800 kg, Gakrobera will prefer to load two minecarts with two stones (total score4002+ 4002= 320 000).InputThe input begins with an integerT(1 ≤T≤ 1000), the number of test cases. ThenTtest cases follow.Each test case is a line of space-separated integers. The first integerN(1 ≤N≤ 106) is the number of stones to be loaded. Next comeNintegersw1, …,wN(1 ≤wi≤ 1000), wherewiis the weight of the stonei.OutputFor each test case, output the smallest possible total score.Exampleinput3\r\n4 700 700 700 700\r\n4 800 800 800 800\r\n10 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000output640000\r\n320000\r\n270000",
