  "text": "A positive integer is apalindromeif its decimal representation (without leading zeros) is a palindromic string (a string that reads the same forwards and backwards). For example, the numbers 5, 77, 363, 4884, 11111, 12121 and 349943 are palindromes.A range of integers isinterestingif it contains an even number of palindromes. The range [L, R], with L ≤ R, is defined as the sequence of integers from L to R (inclusive): (L, L+1, L+2, ... R-1, R). L and R are the range's first and last numbers.The range [L1, R1] is asubrangeof [L, R] if L ≤ L1≤ R1≤ R. Your job is to determine how many interesting subranges of [L, R] there are.InputThe first line of input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow. Each test case is a single line containing two positive integers,LandR(in that order), separated by a space.OutputFor each test case, output one line. That line should contain \"Case #x: y\", where x is the case number starting with 1, and y is the number of interesting subranges of [L, R], modulo 1000000007.Limits1 ≤T≤ 120Small dataset: 1 ≤L≤R≤ 1013Large dataset; 1 ≤L≤R≤ 10100SampleInput:3\r\n1 2\r\n1 7\r\n12 110Output:Case #1: 1\r\nCase #2: 12\r\nCase #3: 2466",
