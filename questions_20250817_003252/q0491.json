  "text": "Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His math’s teacher gives him two numbers a and b. The problem consist of finding the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Nestor with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (0 ≤ a ≤ 20) and the index b (0 ≤ b ≤ 2,147,483,000), a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of ab.InputThe first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t ≤ 30). t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.OutputFor each test case output an integer per line representing the result.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 10\r\n6 2Output:9\r\n6",
