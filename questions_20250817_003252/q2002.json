  "text": "(3, 4, 5)is the smallest almost-isosceles Pythagorean triple,\r\nas4 - 3 = 1.\r\nLetS = { (a,a+1,c) |a2+ (a+1)2=c2withaandcpositive integers}.\r\n\r\nOne can prove that the setSof almost-isosceles Pythagorean triples is infinite.\r\nThere is an obvious total order on this set.InputThe first line of input contains an integerT, the number of test cases.\r\nOn each of the nextTlines, your are given\r\ntwo integersnandm.OutputFor each test case,\r\nyou have to find thenth triple(a,a+1,c)in the ordered setS,\r\nand printaandc.\r\nAs the answer could not fit in a 64-bit container, simply output your answer modulom.ExampleInput:3\r\n1 10\r\n2 123\r\n4 289Output:3 5\r\n20 29\r\n118 118Constraints0 < T < 10^4\r\n0 < n < 10^18\r\n1 < m < 10^9For your information, my 500B-python3 code get AC in 1.61s with 12MB of memory print.\r\nIn Python2.7 : (2.49s, 4.0MB), in Python2+psyco (2.04s, 36MB).\r\nMy 1kB C code ran in (0.04s, 1.6MB), and time limit is Ã—125 this one.Have fun ;-)(edit) With wisfaq observation, all my best timings are divided by exactly two!!! \r\n(Edit 2017-02-11, new TL with new compiler. TL 1.11s, in the third (0.37s) my Python3 code ends.)",
