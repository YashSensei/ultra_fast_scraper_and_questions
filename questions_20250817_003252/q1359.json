  "text": "You are given a bipartite graph with N (1 ≤ N ≤ 300) nodes on each side. Determine whether the number of perfect matching is odd or even.InputFirst line is an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20) means the number of test cases. The following are T parts. Each part begin with an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 300) means the number of nodes on both sides. It followed with N lines, each line contains a 0/1 string. If the j th (1 ≤ j ≤ N) character of the i th (1 ≤ i ≤ N) line is 1, it means the i th node on left have an edge to the j th node on right. See the sample for details.OutputT lines, each contain \"Odd\" or \"Even\", which means the parity of the number of the perfect matching. See the sample for details.ExampleInput:21141100110000110011Output:OddEvenConstraints1 ≤ N ≤ 3001 ≤ T ≤ 20",
