It’s guaranteed that the every added segment will be cleared only once.Q L R: query the number of segment sharing at least a common point with interval [L, R]. 1 <= L <= R <= 1,000,000,000.Inputn(then following n operations ... )Output(for each query, print the result on a single line ... )ExampleInput:6\r\nD 1 3\r\nD 2 4\r\nQ 2 3\r\nD 2 4\r\nC 2\r\nQ 2 3Output:2\r\n2",
