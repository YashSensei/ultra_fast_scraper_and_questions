  "text": "In a secret forest, there are many trolls. They are intelligent and most of them even knows programming languages C or PASCAL. They have written many programs. With their super computers, their programs will run for a very short time and they can get the correct answer. Being an excellent programmer, you can even come up with the answer without computers!!!InputThere's no real input file. The four programs can be downloadedhere.OutputForprogram1.txtandprogram2.txtin the zip file:Your output should contain a single integer denoting the number of \"*\" the program will output.Forprogram3.txtandprogram4.txtin the zip file:Your output should contain a single integer denoting the number the program will output.You can merge the 4 output lines together to get the real output file and submit it.ExampleIfprogram1.txtisvar i:integer;\r\nbegin\r\n  for i:=2 to 8 do write('*');\r\nend.\r\n\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  int i;\r\n  for(i=2; i<=8; i++) printf(\"*\");\r\n}The corresponding line should be:7Ifprogram3.txtisvar a, i: integer;\r\n\r\nbegin\r\n  a := 0;\r\n  for i:= 1 to 9 do\r\n    a := a * 10 + i;\r\n  writeln(a);\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nvoid main() {\r\n  int i, a;\r\n  a = 0;\r\n  for(i=1; i<=9; i++)\r\n    a = a * 10 + i;\r\n  printf(\"%d\\n\", a);\r\n}The correspoding line should be123456789NoteThe numbers fit into the type \"int\" in C program or \"integer\" in PASCAL program in the zip file can be arbitrarily large because the computers used by trolls aresuper computers.",
