We are interested in isosceles right triangles which all the 3 corners at the grid node (integer coordinates). Your task is to count the number of those triangles.InputThe input begins with C – number of test cases.Each test case consists of X, Y.OutputFor each test case, output the result in a line.ConstraintsC ≤ 200 ≤ X, Y ≤ 1000ExampleInput:2\r\n0 3\r\n1 1Output:0\r\n4",
