Each cell of the first row is coloured by one of the colours A, B, C, D such that there are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. You have to colour the second row using colours A, B, C, D such that:There are exactly N cells of each colour (A, B, C and D) in the table.There are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. (Adjacent cells share a vertical or a horizontal side.)It is guaranteed that the solution, not necessarily unique, will always exist.Input[a natural number N â‰¤ 50000][a string of 2N letters from the set {A, B, C, D}, representing the first row of the table]Output[a string of 2N letters from the set {A, B, C, D}, representing the second row of the table]ExampleInput:1\r\nCBOutput:ADInput:2\r\nABADOutput:BCDC",
