  "text": "A triangle made of coins of height h is as follows:It has h coins at the base and h-1 coins one level above base and so on. (Coins are placed as shown in the figure below.)At the top-most level there will be only one coin.Now given h, the task is to invert this triangle by moving the minimum number of coins.For example when h=4 triangle is:For h=4 at least 3 coins must be moved to invert it.InputIn the first line N will be given and then N lines follow with each line having a integer which is the height of triangle in that test case. (0 â‰¤ h < 1010.)OutputFor each test case output in a separate line the minimum number of moves required to invert the triangle. Output fits in long long data type.ExampleInput:1\r\n3Output:2",
