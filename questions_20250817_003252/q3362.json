  "text": "Bill has been the greatest boy scout in America and has become quite a superstar because he\r\nalways organized the most wonderful scavenger hunts (you know, where the kids have to find a\r\ncertain route following certain hints). Bill has retired now, but a nationwide election quickly found\r\na successor for him, a guy called George. He does a poor job, though, and wants to learn from\r\nBill’s routes. Unfortunately Bill has left only a few notes for his successor.\r\nBill never wrote his routes completely, he only left lots of little sheets on which he had written two\r\nconsecutive steps of the routes. He then mixed these sheets and memorized his routes similarly to\r\nhow some people learn for exams: practicing again and again, always reading the first step and\r\ntrying to remember the following. This made much sense, since one step always required something\r\nfrom the previous step.\r\nGeorge however would like to have a route written down as one long sequence of all the steps in\r\nthe correct order. Please help him make the nation happy again by reconstructing the routes.InputThe first line contains the number of scenarios. Each scenario describes one route and its first line\r\ntells you how many steps (3 ≤ S ≤ 333) the route has. The next S − 1 lines each contain one\r\nconsecutive pair of the steps on the route separated by a single space. The name of each step is\r\nalways a single string of letters.OutputThe output for every scenario begins with a line containing “Scenario #i:”, where i is the number\r\nof the scenario starting at 1. Then print S lines containing the steps of the route in correct order.\r\nTerminate the output for the scenario with a blank line.ExampleInput:2\r\n4\r\nSwimmingPool OldTree\r\nBirdsNest Garage\r\nGarage SwimmingPool\r\n3\r\nToilet Hospital\r\nVideoGame ToiletOutput:Scenario #1:\r\nBirdsNest\r\nGarage\r\nSwimmingPool\r\nOldTree\r\n\r\nScenario #2:\r\nVideoGame\r\nToilet\r\nHospital",
