  "text": "Ada the Ladybug was exchanging gifts with her friend. What a surprise - they gave her string. As they like her very much, they brought her a very long string. The goodness of the string is the number of distinct substrings.As you might already know, each letter has different value so Ada wants to know the number of distinct substrings beginning with each letter.InputThe first and the only line line of each test-case will contain a string (formed by lowercase English letters)1 ≤ |s|  ≤ 3×105.OutputFor each test-case, print 26 integers, the number of distinct substrings beginning on given letter.Example InputaaaExample Output3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Example InputabcExample Output3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Example InputaabbaaExample Output10 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Example InputacbabcaExample Output10 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Example InputgdhgaghjdsahgdahjklflklkfsaExample Output50 0 0 57 0 10 84 69 0 30 17 18 0 0 0 0 0 0 18 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Example InputabababababbaaabbabbabababaExample Output130 123 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Example InputaadsdadfafdfafdfsdfafExample Output71 0 0 59 0 40 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 21 0 0 0 0 0 0 0",
