  "text": "The minute hand and hour hand love each other. The ‘Second’ hand is a spy who wants to keep track on how many times they pass over each other in a given interval on a day. Help the second hand.InputFirst line contains the number of test cases t. Each test case has two lines representing the start time and end time respectively. The time would be in format (hh:mm). hh will be between 00 and 23, mm will be between 00 and 59. If the minute and hour hand are overlapping right at the start time (like at 12:00) then it wouldnot be counted. (00:00 ≤ 'start time' < 'end time' ≤ 23:59)OutputFor each test case print, on a separate line, the number of times they overlap each other.ExampleInput:5\r\n00:00\r\n03:00\r\n\r\n00:00\r\n00:10\r\n\r\n06:00\r\n12:00\r\n\r\n11:59\r\n12:01\r\n\r\n00:00\r\n12:00Output:2\r\n0\r\n6\r\n1\r\n11",
