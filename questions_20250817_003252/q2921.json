You are given a string of length n, what is the minimum number of changes required to make a string “PATHETIC”. The string has only lower case letters and you can change any letter to any other letter.Input FormatThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T test cases each containing 1 line: Each testcase consists of a string composed of lowercase letters.Output FormatFor each testcase, print in a new line the minimum number of changes required.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 13701 ≤ n ≤ 1991SampleInput:2\r\nbbaccaaa\r\nccaacbOutput:2\r\n1",
