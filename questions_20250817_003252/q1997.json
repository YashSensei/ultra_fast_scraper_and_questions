  "text": "(3, 4, 5)is a famous Pythagorean triple, it gives a quick answer to the question: For a given integerd, is there a Pythagorean triple(a, b, c)such thatb - a = d?A solution is(3d, 4d, 5d),\r\nand in fact one can easily prove that the set of solutions is infinite, and\r\nthat there is an obvious total order on those solutions.Givenn, you'll have to find thenth term of the sequence of solutions.Geometrically, it is the study of right triangles for which the difference of the\r\ncatheti are equal tod.InputThe first line of input contains an integerT, the number of test cases.Each of the nextTlines contains\r\nthree integersn, d, m.OutputFor each test case, compute thenth term amongst\r\nthe solutions(a, b, c)for the problem :a2+ b2= c2withb - a = dand0 < a < b < c.As the answer could not fit in a 64-bit container, simply output your answer modulom.ExampleInput:3\r\n1 1 235813\r\n3 21 1000\r\n9 119 11Output:3 4 5\r\n63 84 105\r\n5 3 1ExplanationsFor the first case, the first solution is(3, 4, 5), as 4 - 3 = 1.For the second case, the firsts solutions are:(15, 36, 39), (24, 45, 51), (63, 84, 105), (144, 165, 219), (195, 216, 291), (420, 441, 609), ...The third one is(63, 84, 105).For the third case, the first solutions are:(24, 143, 145), (49, 168, 175), (57, 176, 185), (85, 204, 221), (136, 255, 289),\r\n(180, 299, 349), (196, 315, 371), (261, 380, 461), (357, 476, 595), (481, 600, 769),\r\n(616, 735, 959) ...The 9th solution is(357, 476, 595), reduced modulo 11, we get(5, 3, 1).Constraints0 < T < 1050 < n < 1070 < d < 1081 < m < 109n, d, m: Uniform randomly chosen in their range.Constraints allow some interpreted languages to get AC, but it could be hard.\r\nFor your information, I have two distinct solutions.\r\nMy first python3 code get AC under 17s.\r\nMy second python3 code get AC under 8s.\r\n(Timing updated, 2017-02-11 ; after compiler changes)\r\nWith a compiled language, it should be at least 20Ã— faster.
