  "text": "Numbers have feelings too! For any positive integer, take the sum of the squares of each of its digits, and add them together. Take the result, and do it again. A number is Happy if, after repeating this process a finite number of times, the sum is 1. Some happy numbers take more iterations of this process to get to 1 than others, and that would be referred to as its distance from happiness. 1’s distance from happiness is 0. 23’s distance from happiness is 3, since 22+ 32= 13, 12+ 32= 10, and 12+ 02= 1. Numbers are unhappy if they are infinitely far away from happiness because they get stuck in a loop.Given the lower end and upper end of a range of integers, determine how many Unhappy numbers are in that range (inclusive).InputThere will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will consist of two positive integers,loandhi(0 <lo≤hi≤ 1018) on a single line, with a single space between them. Input will terminate with two0s.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer on its own line, indicating the count of Unhappy Numbers betweenloandhi(inclusive). Output no extra spaces, and do not separate answers with blank lines.ExampleInput:1 10\r\n1 100\r\n0 0Output:7\r\n80",
