  "text": "In Hanoi, there are N beauty-spots (2 ≤ N ≤ 200), connected by M one-way streets. The length of each street does not exceed 10000. You are the director of a travel agency, and you want to create some tours around the city which satisfy the following conditions:Each of the N beauty-spots belongs to exactly one tour.Each tour is a cycle which consists of at least 2 places and visits each place once (except for the place we start from which is visited twice).The total length of all the streets we use is minimal.InputThe first line of input contains the number of test cases t (t ≤ 15). The first line of each testcase contains the numbers N, M. The next M lines contain three integers U V W which mean that there is one street from U to V of length W.OutputFor each test case you should output the minimal total length of all tours.ExampleInput:2\r\n6 9\r\n1 2 5\r\n2 3 5\r\n3 1 10\r\n3 4 12\r\n4 1 8\r\n4 6 11\r\n5 4 7\r\n5 6 9\r\n6 5 4\r\n5 8\r\n1 2 4\r\n2 1 7\r\n1 3 10\r\n3 2 10\r\n3 4 10\r\n4 5 10\r\n5 3 10\r\n5 4 3Output:42\r\n40ExplanationTest 1:Tour #1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 ⇒ Length = 20Tour #2: 6 → 5 → 4 → 6 ⇒ Length = 22Test 2:Tour #1: 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 ⇒ Length = 27Tour #2: 5 → 4 → 5 ⇒ Length = 13",
