  "text": "You are given a string S, you need to build another string T by expanding S according to the steps below (traversing left to right):If current character is a letter, append it to T.If current character is a digit, suppose the digit is N, then do T = N*T. Here N*T means appending T N times. See sample for better understanding.Go to next character if exists then restart from step 1.Upon expanding S, you will be given Q queries. For each query you have to print the ithcharacter of the string T.Hint: After expanding the string S = \"a3b2c1\" T will be = \"aaabaaabc\"InputThe first line will be the number of test cases (t <= 10).In the first line of each test you will be given a string consisting of lowercase letters and digits. And it is guaranteed that length of T will be no more than 1000.Next line will contain an integer Q (<= 100000) denoting total numbers of queries. Following Q lines each contains an integer X.OutputFor each query X, you have to print the Xthcharacter of T in a line. If X is greater than the length of T, print -1.ExampleInput:1\r\na3b2c1\r\n2\r\n4\r\n5Output:b\r\na",
