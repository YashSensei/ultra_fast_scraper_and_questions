  "text": "Given a permutation ofnelements (1, 2, ..., n): A = (a1, a2, ..., an). We define a sequence P(A)=(p1, p2, â€¦, pn-1) where pi= 0 if ai> ai+1and pi= 1 if ai< ai+1. Given a permutation B, find the number of all permutations C where P(C)=P(B) including the permutation B itself.The length of your solution should not be more than 0.5kB.InputMultiple test cases. For each test case:The first line contains an integern(1<=n<=100).The second line containsnintegers representing the permutation, all of which are separated by single spaces.Input terminates by a single zero.OutputFor each test case:The output contains a single line with a single integer - the number of the permutations having the same value for P(A) when given the permutation A.ExampleInput:\r\n2\r\n1 2\r\n4\r\n1 3 2 4\r\n0Output:1\r\n5",
