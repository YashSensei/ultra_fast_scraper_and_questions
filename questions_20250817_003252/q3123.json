  "text": "In a billiard table with horizontal sideainches and vertical sidebinches, a ball is launched from the middle of the table. Afters> 0 seconds the ball returns to the point from which it was launched, after having madembounces off the vertical sides andnbounces off the horizontal sides of the table. Find the launching angleA(measured from the horizontal), which will be between 0 and 90 degrees inclusive, and the initial velocity of the ball.Assume that the collisions with a side are elastic (no energy loss), and thus the velocity component of the ball parallel to each side remains unchanged. Also, assume the ball has a radius of zero. Remember that, unlike pool tables, billiard tables have no pockets.InputInput consists of a sequence of lines, each containing five nonnegative integers separated by whitespace. The five numbers are:a,b,s,m, andn, respectively. All numbers are positive integers not greater than 10000.Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes.OutputFor each input line except the last, output a line containing two real numbers (accurate to two decimal places) separated by a single space. The first number is the measure of the angleAin degrees and the second is the velocity of the ball measured in inches per second, according to the description above.ExampleInput:100 100 1 1 1\r\n200 100 5 3 4\r\n201 132 48 1900 156\r\n0 0 0 0 0Output:45.00 141.42\r\n33.69 144.22\r\n3.09 7967.81",
