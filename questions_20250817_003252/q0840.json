  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is visiting her friends who live on a plumtree. As\r\nmany bugs like her, she has a friend in each node. She has already planned in\r\nwhich order she will visit them. She does that in following manner. If she is\r\nstanding at a nodeiin the morning, she will choose shortest path to\r\nfriend with numberi+1. Afterward, she stays there until next morning.\r\nFirst day she \"magically\" appears on node number1and as she arrives at nodeN, she ends her journey. Your task\r\nis to find (for each node), the number of days she visited it (this means she\r\neither begins in it, ends in it or passes through it).InputThe first line contains1 ≤ N ≤ 4×105, number\r\nof nodes on tree.Each of nextN-1lines contains two integers1 ≤ I, J ≤\r\n    N,I ≠ J, the nodes which are connected by an edge.OutputPrintNlines with and integer indicating number of timesithnode was visited.Example Input5\r\n1 2\r\n2 5\r\n2 4\r\n5 3Example Output1\r\n4\r\n2\r\n2\r\n3Example Input 210\r\n1 3\r\n1 5\r\n5 2\r\n5 9\r\n9 7\r\n9 10\r\n6 2\r\n4 2\r\n8 4Example Output 23\r\n8\r\n2\r\n4\r\n8\r\n2\r\n2\r\n2\r\n4\r\n1",
