  "text": "Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written asbn, involving two numbers, the baseband the exponentn. Whennis a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is,bnis the product of multiplyingnbases:bn=  b × b × b × ... × bIn computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes calledmodulus). Given two positive numbers,a(the dividend) andn(the divisor),amodulon(abbreviated asamodn) is the remainder of the Euclidean division ofabyn. For instance, the expression \"5 mod 2\" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while \"9 mod 3\" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3.Now, you are given the value of a, b and m. print the value ofabmod m.InputFirst line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 104). Next t line contains three integers a, b and m. where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109and 1 ≤ m ≤ 264.OutputFor each test case print the answer of the problem.Sample input2\r\n2 3 4\r\n3 4 5Sample output0\r\n1",
