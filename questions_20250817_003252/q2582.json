  "text": "A fraction tree is an infinite binary tree defined as follows:Every node of tree contains a fraction.Root of tree contains the fraction 1/1.Any node with fraction i/j has two children: left child with fraction i / (i + j) and right child with fraction (i + j) / j.For example, fraction tree up to 3 levels is as shown:We number the nodes according to increasing levels (root is at level 1) and at any same level, nodes are numbered from left to right. So first node holds the fraction 1/1, second one holds 1/2, third one holds 2/1 fourth one holds 1/3 and so on.Your task is simple, as always! Given two numbers a and b, you are to find the product of fractions at all those nodes whose number is between a and b both inclusive.InputEvery line of the input contains two numbers a and b separated by a space. You are to find the product of all fractions which are at node having number between a and b both inclusive. Input file terminates with a 0 0 which is not to be processed.OutputFor each input, print numerator and denominator of the lowest form of the fraction separated by a /. Output of each case to be on separate lines.ExampleInput:1 1\r\n1 2\r\n2 4\r\n0 0Output:1/1\r\n1/2\r\n1/3Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 300001 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1010",
