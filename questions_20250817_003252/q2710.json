  "text": "Little boy maze invented a brand new data type that can store data from 1 to M inclusive. The specialty of the invented data type is if you want to store a data out of the range it can round the data and map with invented data type.for example if the range is 1 to 7 and you want to store 9 then the system round 9 and map with 2.Now you're given a number in the format  ABand the upper limit M of range. Can you round the number to map with new data type?InputInput starts with T ≤ 100000.in the next T lines there will be three integers (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000000000000000, 1 < M < 1000000000).OutputFor each case print the desire output.ExampleInput:2\r\n2 3 5\r\n4 2 15Output:3\r\n1",
