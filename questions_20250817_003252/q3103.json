  "text": "You are given n integers a1, a2... an(0 ≤ ai≤ n). The sum a1+ a2+ ... + andoes not exceeded n.\r\nYour task is to find n other integers x1, x2... xn(note that ximay be negative numbers) satisfying the following conditions:(xi- xi+1+ ai+1= 0) or (xi- xi+1+ ai+1= 1) for i=1..n-1(xn- x1+ a1= 0) or (xn- x1+ a1= 1)|x1|+|x2|+ ... +|xn| is minimizedInputThe first line of the input file contains an integer t representing the number of test cases (t ≤ 20). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:The first line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)The second line contains n integers a1, a2... anseparated by single spacesOutputFor each test case output a single value: the minimum value of |x1|+|x2|+ ... +|xn|ExampleInput:2\r\n4\r\n2 1 0 0\r\n5\r\n0 1 2 2 0Output:1\r\n3ExplanationIn the former case, the optimal solution is (x1=0, x2=0, x3=0, x4=-1)In the latter case, the optimal solution is (x1=-1, x2=-1, x3=0, x4=1, x5=0)",
