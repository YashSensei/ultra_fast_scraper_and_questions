  "text": "For an integer find the multiplicative digital root of it! Multiple all nonzero digits of that number and repeat this process until it is only a single digit. We call that digit the multiplicative digital root of the number. For example the multiplicative digital root ofn= 2009 is 8, because the first iteration is: 2 × 9 = 18, the second is 1 × 8 = 8, and we stop here.InputThe first line of the input file contains one integerT, the number of test cases.\r\nThe followingTlines each contains a big positive integer:n, wheren< 1010000.OutputOutput the multiplicative digital root for each n.ExampleInput:4\r\n6\r\n2009\r\n555555555\r\n847938630482747410708417738635300464477112059683336648877683Output:6\r\n8\r\n5\r\n2Warning: large input data, be careful with certain languages, and not every language is available for this task.",
