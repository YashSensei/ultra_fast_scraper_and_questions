  "text": "Ajoy has got some spare time today. He is using this spare time to think of a particular kind of number.He calls it a ‘Peculiar Number’.A peculiar number is define by three integers A, B and C and has the following characteristics:If a number is a multiple of A but not a multiple of B then it is a peculiar number.If a number is a multiple of both A and B then it will be a peculiar number only if it is also a multiple of number C. Otherwise it is not a peculiar number.Now, Ajoy is trying to find the Nth peculiar number for a fixed A, B and C.But Ajoy does not have all day. So he needs your help to solve the problem.InputFirst line of the input contains four integers A, B, C  and M where (1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 103) and (1 ≤ M ≤ 105) constraints hold.M denotes the number of queries.Each of the next M line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 109).OutputFor each query, print the Nth peculiar number.ExampleInput #13 2 4 3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3Output #13\r\n9\r\n12Input #2983 991 997 3\r\n323233123\r\n2131234\r\n1000000000Output #2318058785019\r\n2097116472\r\n983991931538(set by: Nashir Ahmed)",
