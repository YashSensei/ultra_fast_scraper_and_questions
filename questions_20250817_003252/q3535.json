  "text": "Leo searched for a new fib-like problem, and ...it's not a fib-like problem that he found !!! Here it is.Let  FIB  the Fibonacci function :FIB(0)=0 ; FIB(1)=1andfor N>=2  FIB(N) = FIB(N-1) + FIB(N-2)Example : we have FIB(6)=8, and FIB(8)=21.Let F(K, N) a new function:F(0, N) = N for all integers N.F(K, N) = F(K-1, FIB(N) ) for K>0 and all integers N.Example : F(2, 6) = F(1, FIB(6) ) = F(0, FIB( FIB(6) ) ) = FIB( FIB(6) ) = FIB(8) = 21InputThe input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.In each of the next T lines there are three integers: K, N, M.OutputFor each test case, print F(K, N),as the answer could not fit in a 64bit container,give your answer modulo M.ExampleInput:3\r\n4 5 1000\r\n3 4 1000\r\n2 6 1000Output:5\r\n1\r\n21Constraints1 <= T <= 10^3\r\n0 <= K <= 10^18\r\n0 <= N <= 10^18\r\n2 <= M <= 10^18K, N, M are uniform randomly chosen.You would perhaps have a look, before, at themedium editionwith easier constraints.Edit(12/I/2015) My old Python code now ends in 2.19s using PY3.4 and cube cluster.Edit(11/2/2017) Compiler updates ; my old Python3.5 code ends in 0.98s.
