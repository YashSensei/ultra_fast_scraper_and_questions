  "text": "Let us consider a set of fractions x/y, such that 0 ≤ x/y ≤ 1, y ≤ n and gcd(x, y) = 1.For example, say n = 5. Then we have the following set in increasing order :0⁄1,1⁄5,1⁄4,1⁄3,2⁄5,1⁄2,3⁄5,2⁄3,3⁄4,4⁄5,1⁄1You are given n, a and b. The task is to find the rank of a/b in a set of fractions as stated above which is in increasing order.InputThe first line of the input contains t (t ≤ 20), the number of test cases. Then t lines follow. In each of the t lines you are given n, a and b. (n ≤ 100000).OutputPrint t lines. The ith line contains the rank of a fraction a/b for a given n, a and b in the (i + 1)th line of input. All answers fit within a signed integer.ExampleInput:2\r\n5 3 4\r\n8 5 7Output:9\r\n17",
