  "text": "We consider a sequenceS1isequalto a sequenceS2, if and only if they satisfy the following conditions:The length of them are equal.LetLenbe the length of them. For each i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤Len, i ≠ j):IfS1[i] is smaller thanS1[j],S2[i] must be smaller thanS2[j]; IfS1[i] is greater thanS1[j],S2[i] must greater thanS2[j].Now you are given a sequenceSand anotherNsequencesT1,T2….TN.We say positioniisOK, if and only ifS[1..i] contains a suffix which isequalto a sequence from {T1,T2...TN}. You need to print the positions which isOKin increasing order.InputMultiple test cases, the number of them(no more than 3) is given in the very first line.For each test case:The first line contains an integerM(M> 1) which denote the number of sequences.i.e.M=N+ 1.M× 2 lines follow, each two lines describe one sequence. For each two lines, the first line contains an integerLwhich denote the length of this sequence. The second line containsLintegers (all the integers don't exceed 231-1) that represent this sequence.\r\nThe first sequence described isS, the nextNsequences representT1...TN.You can assume that there are no same integer in any one sequence.The length ofSis no more than 400000, and the total length ofTis no more than 100000.OutputFor each test case: Print the positions which isOKin increasing order.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n3 1 2\r\n2\r\n4 5\r\n2\r\n10 1Output:1\r\n2\r\n3",
