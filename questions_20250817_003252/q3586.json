  "text": "Its holiday time after exams and Kappi and Pushap are enjoying to its fullest. But the sadist Sid, their\r\nteacher, can’t see them enjoy. Sad isn’t it? To ruin their fun, he gave them a programming problem to be\r\nsolved within next 5 hours. He gives them 2 square matrices of equal dimension, Matrix A and a Matrix\r\nB and asks multiple queries on these matrices. The queries will be to change a particular element of one\r\nof the matrix and output the sum of elements of product of their matrix. Sid asks a lot of such queries.\r\nKappi and Pushap don’t want the end of fun and so they ask you to solve this problem on behalf of\r\nthem.InputFirst line consists of N, the dimension of matrix.Each of the next N lines contains N space separated integers. This is matrix A.Each of the next N lines contains N space separated integers. This is matrix B.Next line contains Q, the number of queries asked by Sid.Each of the next Q lines consists of queries of the form “A i j K” or “B i j K” (quotes for clarity), meaning\r\nchange the element in ith row and jth column of matrix A or B to value K.OutputOutput exactly Q lines corresponding to Q queries, each containing the sum of the elements of the matrix A × B.ExampleInput:2\r\n1 2\r\n3 4\r\n4 3\r\n2 1\r\n3\r\nA 1 1 2\r\nB 0 1 3\r\nA 0 0 10Output:40\r\n40\r\n103Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 1001 ≤ Q ≤ 1000000 ≤ i, j < N-106≤ A[i][j], B[i][j] ≤ 106",
