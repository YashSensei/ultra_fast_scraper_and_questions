  "text": "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.We define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is a prime number that consists of other prime numbers less than this number.Example:1013 consists of 101 and 3 and both are prime.Notes: 2003 is not POP because leading zeros are not allowed.The POP numbers must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping is not allowed .InputThe first line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases. (T ≤ 200)Followed by T lines, each line contains an integer m number 0 ≤ m ≤ 1018.OutputFor each test case print single line contain the first integer greater than or equal to m and is (POP) .ExampleInput3\r\n10\r\n100\r\n1000Output23\r\n113\r\n1013After solving this you can tryPOP3",
