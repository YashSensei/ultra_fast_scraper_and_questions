  "text": "You are given a tree (a connected, acyclic graph) along with a set ofcommodities, i.e. pairs of vertices, (s1,t1),...,(sm,tm) (si≠ti).  Amulticutis a set of edges that when removed disconnectssifromtifor alli.  There is a unique pathPu,vbetween every pair of verticesu,vin a tree, and themax-costof a multicutSis maxi|S∩Psi, ti|.  You will be given a rooted tree of height1and a set of commodities and must return the minimum possible max-cost over all multicuts.InputThe first line of the input is \"N M\" (1≤N, M≤100000),\r\nwhereNis the number of vertices in the tree andMis the number\r\nof commodities.  All vertices are numbered0, ...,N-1, and the\r\nroot has labelN - 1.Mlines then follow, where theith line\r\nis \"siti\", representing a commodity (si,ti) wheresi≠ti.  Commodities are distinct: neither (si,ti) = (sj,tj)\r\nnor (si,ti) = (tj,sj) will hold wheni≠j.OutputYour output should consist of a single number, the minimum possible\r\nmax-cost of a multicut, followed by a newline.ExampleInput:10 2\r\n0 5\r\n4 8Output:1",
