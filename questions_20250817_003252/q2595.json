  "text": "One way of finding the maximum element in an array is to initialize a variable to the first element in the array, iterate through the remaining array, and update the variable whenever a value strictly greater than it is found. Assuming that the array contains N elements each in the range 1..K, how many such arrays exist such that the above algorithm performs exactly P updates? Initialization of the variable is not counted as an update.For example, the possible arrays for N = 4, K = 3 and P = 2 are:{1, 1, 2, 3}{1, 2, 1, 3}{1, 2, 2, 3}{1, 2, 3, 1}{1, 2, 3, 2}{1, 2, 3, 3}InputThe first line contains T the number of test cases. There follows T lines, each containing 3 space separated integers N, K and P.OutputOutput T lines, one for each test case. On each line, output the answer as asked above. Since the answers can get very big, output the answer modulo 1000000007.ExampleSample Input:3\r\n4 3 2\r\n2 3 1\r\n3 4 1Sample Output:6\r\n3\r\n30Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1001 ≤ n ≤ 1001 ≤ K ≤ 3000 ≤ P < n",
