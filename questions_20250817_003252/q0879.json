  "text": "The problem is to calculate the coefficients in expansion of polynomial(x1+x2+...+xk)n.InputThe input will consist of a set of pairs of lines. The first line of the  pair consists of two integersnandkseparated with space (0 < n, k <13). This integers define the power of the polynomial and the amount of the variables. The second line in each pair consists ofknon-negative integersn1, ...,  nk,wheren1+...+nk=n.OutputFor each input pair of lines the output line should consist one integer,  the coefficient by the monomialx1n1x2n2...xknkin expansion of the polynomial(x1+x2+...+xk)n.ExampleInput:2 2\r\n1 1\r\n2 12\r\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0Output:2\r\n2",
