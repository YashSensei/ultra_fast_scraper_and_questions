  "text": "A number of bacteria lie on an infinite grid of cells, each bacterium in its own cell.Each second, the following transformations occur (all simultaneously):If a bacterium has no neighbor to its north and no neighbor to its west, then it will die.If a cell has no bacterium in it, but there are bacteria in the neighboring cells to the north and to the west, then a new bacterium will be born in that cell.Upon examining the grid, you note that there are a positive, finite number of bacteria in one or more rectangular regions of cells.Determine how many seconds will pass before all the bacteria die.Here is an example of a grid that starts with 6 cells containing bacteria, and takes 6 seconds for all the bacteria to die. '1's represent cells with bacteria, and '0's represent cells without bacteria.000010\r\n011100\r\n010000\r\n010000\r\n000000\r\n\r\n000000\r\n001110\r\n011000\r\n010000\r\n000000\r\n\r\n000000\r\n000110\r\n001100\r\n011000\r\n000000\r\n\r\n000000\r\n000010\r\n000110\r\n001100\r\n000000\r\n\r\n000000\r\n000000\r\n000010\r\n000110\r\n000000\r\n\r\n000000\r\n000000\r\n000000\r\n000010\r\n000000\r\n\r\n000000\r\n000000\r\n000000\r\n000000\r\n000000InputThe input consists of:One line containingC, the number of test cases.Then for each test case:One line containingR, the number of rectangles of cells that initially contain bacteria.Rlines containing four space-separated integersX1Y1X2Y2. This indicates that all the cells with X coordinate between X1and X2, inclusive, and Y coordinate between Y1and Y2, inclusive, contain bacteria.The rectangles may overlap.North is in the direction of decreasing Y coordinate, and west is in the direction of decreasing X coordinate.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing \"Case #N: T\", where N is the case number (starting from 1), and T is the number of seconds until the bacteria all die.Limits1 ≤C≤ 100.1 ≤R≤ 10001 ≤X1≤X2≤ 10000001 ≤Y1≤Y2≤ 1000000The number of cells initially containing bacteria will be at most 1000000.SampleInput1\r\n3\r\n5 1 5 1\r\n2 2 4 2\r\n2 3 2 4OutputCase #1: 6",
