  "text": "BackgroundIn 1949 the Indian mathematician D.R. Kaprekar discovered a class of numbers calledself-numbers. For any positive integern, defined(n)to benplus the sum of the digits ofn. (Thedstands fordigitadition, a term coined by Kaprekar.) For example:d(75) = 75 + 7 + 5 = 87Given any positive integer n as a starting point, you can construct the infinite increasing sequence of integersn, d(n), d(d(n)), d(d(d(n))), ...For example, if you start with 33, the next number is 33 + 3 + 3 = 39, the next is 39 + 3 + 9 = 51, the next is 51 + 5 + 1 = 57, and so you generate the sequence33, 39, 51, 57, 69, 84, 96, 111, 114, 120, 123, 129, 141, ...The numbernis called ageneratorofd(n). In the sequence above, 33 is a generator of 39, 39 is a generator of 51, 51 is a generator of 57, and so on.Some numbers have more than one generator: For example, 101 has two generators, 91 and 100. A number with no generators is aself-number. There are thirteen self-numbers less than 100: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 31, 42, 53, 64, 75, 86, and 97.ProblemWrite a program to output all positive self-numbers less than 1000000 in increasing order, one per line.InputThere is no input.OutputAll positive self-numbers less than 1000000 in increasing order, one per line.",
