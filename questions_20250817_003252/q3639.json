  "text": "Q[b] has recently been visited byextra-terrestrialsfrom planetQuan_Lank, where everyone’s name is a positive integer.All residentsof the planetknow each other. Two  Quan_Lank-ians calculate the strength of their friendship by converting their names to binary, aligning them one under the other, and writing a digit in each column: 0 if the two binary digits in that column are equal, 1 if they differ. The binary result is then converted back to the decimal system.For example, the friendship value of 19 and 10 equals 25:1   0   0   1   1   =  19\r\n0   1   0   1   0   =  10\r\n-------------------------\r\n1   1   0   0   1   =  25Thevalue of a planetin the Universe is defined as the sum of all friendship values. Q[b] has asked you to help him compute the value of planet Quan_Lank!InputThe first line of input contains the positive integer N (the number of residents of planet Quan_Lank, 1 ≤ N ≤ 106).The next N lines contain the names of residents - positive integers smaller than 106, one per line.OutputThe only line of output must contain the value of planet Quan_Lank.SampleInput:21910Output:25Input:3735Output:12Second sample description: The friendship value of residents 1 and 2 equals 4, for residents 1 and 3 it equals 2, and for residents 2 and 3 it equals 6. The solution is 4 + 2 + 6 = 12.",
