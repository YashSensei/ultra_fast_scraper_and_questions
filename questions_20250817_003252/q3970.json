  "text": "A game is played where two armies face each other. Each turn, every unit in both armies either scores a hit or a miss. Each army then removes a number of units equal to the number of hits scored by the opposing army. The game is over when at the end of a turn, one army does not have any more units. If both armies run out of units on the same turn, the game is a draw. The probability of any one unit scoring a hit is determined at the beginning of the game and remains constant.The goal is to determine the probability of army A winning, army B winning, or the game ending in a draw.ExampleIf the probability of scoring a hit is 0.3, army A has 2 units, and army B has 1 unit, then A has a 0.86839 chance of winning, B has a 0.09213 chance of winning and there is a 0.03948 chance of a draw.InputThe first line contains a single positive integerT, representing the number of test cases.Ttest cases follow. Each test case is two lines long. The first line of each test case contains a single decimal numberH. The second line contains two positive integersAandB, representing the number of units in each army.Limits0 <H<= 10 <A,B<= 1,000,000OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing three decimal numbers representing the chance of A winning, B winning and ending in a draw, respectively. Each number should rounded to exactly 5 decimal places.ExampleInput:2\r\n0.3\r\n2 1\r\n0.854\r\n8 8Output:0.86839 0.09213 0.03948\r\n0.38532 0.38532 0.22936",
