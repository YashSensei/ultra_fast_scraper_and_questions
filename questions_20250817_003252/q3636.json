  "text": "The description of this problem is extremely simple. You are given2 non-intersecting circlesin 3-dimensional world. Each of the circles is defined by3 non - collinear pointslying on the circle. All you have to return is whether the circles are entangled or not (just like two links of a chain). Two circles are entangled if they cannot be separated from each other without breaking any of the circles.InputThe first line contains a single integer,T, the number of test cases. Each of theTtest cases are defined by2lines. The first line of each test case contains9integers representing the3points as(x1, y1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), (x3, y3, z3)which define the first circle. Similarly, the second line for each test case contains9integers representing the3points which define the second circle.Outpu:For every query output\"YES\"without quotes if the circles are entangled and\"NO\"otherwise (quotes for clarity).Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 100-10000 ≤ Each Coordinate in the Input ≤ 10000SampleInput1\r\n0 1 0 1 0 0 0 -1 0\r\n0 0 0 1 0 -1 1 0 1OutputYESProblem Setter: Lalit Kundu",
