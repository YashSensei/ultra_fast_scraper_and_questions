Single minus operator (for example -a*b) is not allowed.Two expression are distinct if for some valid input values (i.e. You won't divide some number by zero)a,b,c... the two expressions leads to different results. For example, a/b/c and a/(b*c) are the same expressions, but a/b+c and a/(b+c) are not.InputMultiple test cases. For each test case:A single line -n. (1 ≤n≤ 2000).Input terminates by a single zero.OutputFor each test case:The number of different expressions, modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n0Output:68The time limit has been changed to 1 second.
