  "text": "XerK had prepared his new problem with some sums of primes up to some bounds. His results are well here, but he forgot the bounds.Your task is to find which was the last prime in the sum.This problem is extremely simple, but you have to be extremely fast.InputThe lonely line of input contains an integerS.OutputYou have to print the last primePsuch thatsum(prime from 2 to P) = S.ExamplesInput 1:77Output 1:19Input 2:24739512092254535Output 2:999999937ExplanationThe first sum was 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 +19= 77Constraints0 < P â‰¤ 1012The challenge problemSUMPRIM1is the reverse task.\r\nTime limit is set to allow some slow languages to finish in time, it could be hard.\r\nFor your information, there's a total of 20 input files.\r\n;-) Have fun.You may try before an excellent tutorial problem (Twin Primes) and make some speed experiments.\r\nYou could take benefit too by working withPRINT, another excellent tutorial problem.",
