  "text": "Roger was having fun solving his problems until he found this one. As you know, an undirected connected graph withNnodes andN-1edges is called a tree. You are given an integer'K'and a tree consisting of'N'nodes. Each node'i'has a valuea(i)associated with it.We call a path'P'of tree valid if following conditions are satisfied:Phas at least 2 nodes associated with it.Max a(u) - Min a(u) >= K(u belongs to the nodes present in the chosen P).Your task is to count the number of Valid Paths.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integersNandK.The second line containsNspace-separated positive integersa(1), a(2) ... a(n).Then the nextn - 1line each contains a pair of integersuandvdenoting that there is an edge between u and v.OutputPrint the number of Valid Paths.ExampleInput:3 1\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 2\r\n2 3Output:3Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 50001 ≤ u, v ≤ N0 ≤ K ≤ 1090 ≤  ai ≤ 109Like trees?
