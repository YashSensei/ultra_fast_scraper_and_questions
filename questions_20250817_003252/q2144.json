He believes that the term “ALL IZZ WELL” will make everything fine. Now your task is to ignore the story above and find whether there is a path in the given matrix which makes the sentence “ALL IZZ WELL”There is a path from any cell to all its neighbouring cells. A neighbour may share an edge or a corner.InputThe first line consists of an integer t representing the number of test cases.The first line of each test case consists of two integers R and C representing the number of rows and number of columns in the matrix. The description of the matrix follows.OutputFor each test case print “YES” if there is a path which makes the sentence “ALLIZZWELL”. Else print “NO”.Note:Take care of 4th test case.There is a new line after every test case in the input.Constraintst ≤ 1000R ≤ 100C ≤ 100ExampleInput:5\r\n3 6\r\nAWE.QX\r\nLLL.EO\r\nIZZWLL\r\n\r\n1 10\r\nALLIZZWELL\r\n\r\n2 9\r\nA.L.Z.E..\r\n.L.I.W.L.\r\n\r\n3 3\r\nAEL\r\nLWZ\r\nLIZ\r\n\r\n1 10\r\nLLEWZZILLAOutput:YES\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nNO\r\nYES",
