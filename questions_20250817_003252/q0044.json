  "text": "In a wireless network with multiple transmitters sending on the same\r\nfrequencies, it\r\nis often a requirement that signals don't overlap, or at least that they don't\r\nconflict. One way of accomplishing this is to restrict a transmitter's coverage\r\narea. This problem uses a shielded transmitter that \r\nonly broadcasts in a semicircle.A transmitterTis located somewhere on a 1,000 square meter grid.\r\nIt broadcasts in a semicircular area of radiusr. The\r\ntransmitter may be rotated any amount, but not moved. \r\nGivenNpoints anywhere on the grid, compute\r\nthe maximum number of points that can be simultaneously reached by the\r\ntransmitter's signal.\r\nFigure 1 shows the\r\nsame data points with two different transmitter rotations.All input coordinates are integers (0-1000). The radius is a\r\npositive real number greater than 0.\r\nPoints on the boundary of a semicircle are considered within that\r\nsemicircle.  There are 1-150 unique points to examine per transmitter.\r\nNo points are at the same location as the transmitter.Input consists of information for one or more independent transmitter problems.\r\nEach problem begins with\r\none line containing the (x,y) coordinates of the transmitter followed by the\r\nbroadcast radius,r.\r\nThe next line contains the number of pointsNon the grid,\r\nfollowed byNsets of (x,y) coordinates, one\r\nset per line.  The end of the input is signalled by a line with a\r\nnegative radius; the (x,y) values will be present but indeterminate.\r\nFigures 1 and 2 represent the data in the first two example data sets below,\r\nthough they are on different scales. Figures 1a and 2 show\r\ntransmitter rotations that result in maximal coverage.For each transmitter, the output contains a single line with \r\nthe maximum number of points that can be contained in some semicircle.Input:25 25 3.5\r\n7\r\n25 28\r\n23 27\r\n27 27\r\n24 23\r\n26 23\r\n24 29\r\n26 29\r\n350 200 2.0\r\n5\r\n350 202\r\n350 199\r\n350 198\r\n348 200\r\n352 200\r\n995 995 10.0\r\n4\r\n1000 1000\r\n999 998\r\n990 992\r\n1000 999\r\n100 100 -2.5Output:3\r\n4\r\n4",
