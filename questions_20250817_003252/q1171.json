  "text": "Your task consists of evaluate a polynomial of degreen(0<=n<=999) represented by itsn+1coefficients of the form:pn(x)  = cnxn+ cn-1xn-1+ … + c2x2+ c1x + c0in each one of thek(1<=k<=100) pointsx1,x2,  …,xk. The coefficients of the polynomial and the values where they will be evaluated are integers in the interval[-100, 100]that guarantees that the polynomial's evaluation is at the most263– 1.InputThere will be multiple test cases, each one with4lines that are described belown: degree of polynomial.cncn-1…  c2c1c0: coefficients of the polynomial separated by a single space.k: number of points to evaluate the polynomial.x1x2…xk-1xk: points to evaluate the polynomial separated by a single space.The final test case is a single line wheren = -1and this case should not be processed.OutputFor each test case you should printk + 1lines of output, the very first line containing the case number and the followingklines with the result of the polynomial's evaluation in each one of thekgiven points. See the sample.ExampleInput:21 -2 -150 1 -1 2 -232 1 -2 -140 -1 2 -2-1Output:Case 1:-1-22-17Case 2:-1015-9",
