  "text": "Little Johnny is playing with his small magical stamp, trying to draw a bunny on a piece of paper that is a\r\nsquare k by k divided into unit squares with side 1. Johnny’s stamp is a square with side 3 and consists of\r\nsmaller squares with side 1. Exactly two of these squares are protuberant. Moreover, both protuberant squares\r\nare in the same row or in the same column. If Johnny wants to draw pictures using this stamp, he presses it\r\nto the piece of paper in such a way that its protuberant squares exactly match some squares of the piece of\r\npaper. If some protuberant square touches the piece of paper, the touched square on the piece of paper changes\r\nits colour — from black to white or from white to black. The small stamp may lay partially outside the piece\r\nof paper, but the protuberant squares always have to lay inside. The stamp can be shifted in any way, but it\r\ncannot be rotated.In the beginning the piece of paper is whole white. The bunny consists of some number of squares that\r\nare black (all the remaining ones have to be white). Johnny tried to draw the bunny with his small stamp for\r\nquite a long time, but he did not succeed (this does not necessarily mean that the bunny cannot be drawn,\r\nbut only that it is very difficult to draw pictures on such a large piece of paper using such a small stamp!). So\r\nhe asked his older brother, big John, for help.Big John can help little Johnny by giving him his big magical stamp. The big stamp has size s by s and\r\nhas an arbitrary number of protuberant squares (these squares do not necessarily need to be located in the\r\nsame row or column). This stamp works just like the small stamp, but enforces one additional constraint — it\r\ncan only be pressed at the piece of paper if it lies totally inside the piece of paper.Before big John gives little Johnny his big stamp, he would like to make sure that the stamps used together\r\nare sufficient to draw the bunny. He asked you for help in determining that.InputThe first line of the standard input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) denoting the number of test cases.A description of a single test case starts with a line with two integers s and k (1 ≤ s ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ s ≤ 200)\r\nseparated by a single space. They denote the size of big John’s stamp and the size of the piece of paper.The following three lines contain a description of the little Johnny’s stamp. Each of these lines contains three\r\ncharacters 0 or 1. Such a description shows how does a white piece of paper look like after pressing the small\r\nstamp: 0 represents a white square, and 1 — a black square. Exactly two characters in these three lines are\r\nones and are both located either in the same row or in the same column. Please note that such description\r\ndoes not illustrate the design of the stamp itself — the stamp is symmetric to the figure drawn by it on the\r\npiece of paper.The following s lines contain a description of the big John’s stamp in a similar format; this description\r\nmay, however, contain an arbitrary number of ones.\r\nThe following k lines describe the bunny, in the same format as the one used in the descriptions of stamps.\r\nA one represents a black square, whereas a zero — a white square.OutputFor each test case write out to the standard output a single line with a word TAK (’yes’ in Polish) or NIE (’no’\r\nin Polish), depending on whether the bunny from the test case can be drawn using the stamps from the test\r\ncase (together).ExampleFor the input data:2\r\n3 8\r\n010\r\n000\r\n010\r\n000\r\n010\r\n011\r\n01100000\r\n00100000\r\n00010000\r\n00001100\r\n00011110\r\n10111100\r\n01111100\r\n01111110\r\n5 10\r\n001\r\n001\r\n000\r\n00000\r\n10100\r\n00001\r\n00001\r\n00100\r\n0011110000\r\n0000111000\r\n0010011100\r\n0111001110\r\n1110000000\r\n1101001000\r\n1000001100\r\n0110110110\r\n0001001000\r\n0000110000the correct result is:NIE\r\nTAKRemark: In the test data, the pictures that little Johnny is trying to draw do not need to resemble a ‘real’\r\nbunny.",
