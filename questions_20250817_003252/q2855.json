  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is playingGame of Digitsagainst her friend Velvet Mite Vinit. The game is played in following manner: At first, there is a four-digit number and a number of moves. Both Ada and Vinit take turns alternately (beginning with Ada). Both of them must increase ANY digit of the number, but if the digit was 9 it will become 0.For example number 3590 can be expanded to: 4590, 3690, 3500 or 3591. If after all turns the number is greater than the original number, Ada wins - otherwise Vinit is the winner. Both of them play optimally - can you decide who is the winner?PS: It is possible, that Ada will have one more turn (if number of turns is odd)InputFirst line of input will consistT ≤ 200number of test-cases.  Each testcase will consist of four digit number0 ≤ N < 104[the original number] and0 ≤ M ≤ 100[the number of turns].OutputFor each test-case, print the name of winner (\"Ada\" or \"Vinit\").Example Input5\r\n0000 0\r\n5566 3\r\n3333 10\r\n9999 9\r\n1234 30Example OutputVinit\r\nAda\r\nAda\r\nVinit\r\nAda",
