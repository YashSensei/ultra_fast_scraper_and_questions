  "text": "Alp and Gaut are like always opposite to each other. Once Alp told that he can identify a number which is divisible by 252 (He knows because that is his girlfriends birthday - 25/2). Now to come up against Alp, Gaut said he can identify whether the number is divisible by 525 (poor Gaut don't have a girlfriend though). The truth is they don't know to do it for big numbers. So you are here to help them with a method. Given a number you have to tell whether the number is divisible by 252 and 525.InputNumber of testcases in first line, T (T ≤ 100).Each line contains one number N, whose divisibility is to be tested (1 ≤ N ≤ 1050000).OutputEach line containing two Yes/No. one for 252 and one for 525.ExampleInput:4\r\n252\r\n525\r\n16884\r\n21347Output:Yes No\r\nNo Yes\r\nYes No\r\nNo No",
