  "text": "In today's math lesson, Little Crash has just learnt Least Common Multiple (LCM). For two positive integersaandb, LCM(a,b) means the minimum positive integer which can be divisible byaandb.After coming home, Crash is still thinking about what he learnt in  the math lesson. Then he draw a table filled numbers in order to  research LCM. The table hasNrows andMcolumns. The number in theith row andjth column is LCM(i,j).A table of 4×5 is just like this:1234522641036312154412420Now Little Crash wants to know the sum of all the numbers in the table. You just need to output the sum modulo 20101009.InputOnly two positive integers stand forNandM. (N,M≤ 107)OutputA positive integer which means the sum modulo 20101009.ExampleInput:4 5Output:122",
