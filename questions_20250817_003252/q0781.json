  "text": "Saitama is the most powerful hero alive. Having apparently trained himself to superhuman conditions, Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroic deeds. Every monster he faces is killed with only one punch.There areNgroups of monsters on a line,ith of them is positioned at distanceXifrom the beginning of that line and hasVimembers. When Saitama punches the ground atP, all monsters withinRvicinity of that punch (meaning fromP-RtoP+Rboth inclusive) are killed by the shockwave. Saitama is tired after all his hero duties. So he will punch at mostKtimes. Can you help him figure out, what is the maximum number of monsters he can kill.InputThe first line contains number of test casesT. ThenTtest cases follow. First line of each test case contains three integersN,Randk. FollowingNlines contains two space separated integersXiandVi.OutputFor each test case, print a line \"Case t: m\" where t is the test case number and m is the the maximum number of monsters Saitama can kill.LimitsT≤ 101 ≤N≤ 1051 ≤Vi≤ 1041 ≤K≤ 50ForEasyVersion: 0 ≤R, Xi≤ 104ForHardVersion: 0 ≤R, Xi≤ 108SampleInput:2\r\n4 3 1\r\n6 10\r\n12 110\r\n19 100\r\n24 30\r\n5 3 2\r\n3 3\r\n5 2\r\n3 8\r\n10 5\r\n0 5Output:Case 1: 130\r\nCase 2: 23Explanation of SampleIn sample 1, Saitama can punch at position 21 or 22 to kill 130 monsters. If he punches at position 21 then the shockwave ranges from 18 to 24, killing monsters at 19 and 24. Similarly if he punches at 22 then then shockwave will kill from 19 to 25. Punch at no other position will kill more monsters.In Sample 2, Saitama can kill all monsters with 2 punches.Problem Setter: Moinul Shaon",
