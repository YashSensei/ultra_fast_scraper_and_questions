  "text": "You have an array containingNelements. At any move, you choose two indicesiandj(0 ≤i,j<Nandi≠j) and increment value at one index and decrement value at other index. You can make this move any number of times. What is the maximum number of elements which can have the same value (after any number of moves) ?InputFirst line consists ofT, the number of test cases. (1 ≤T≤ 100)Tsets follow. Each set containsN, the number of elements in the array, in the first line. (1 ≤N≤ 100000)Next line of each set consists ofNspace separated integers (0 ≤ value ≤ 100000)OutputOutputTlines each containing the required answer.ExampleInput:1\r\n4\r\n1 2 3 4Output:3",
