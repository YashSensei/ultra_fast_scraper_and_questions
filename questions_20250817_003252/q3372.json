  "text": "Given a sequence ofNordered pairs of positive integers (Ai,Bi), you have to \r\n\r\npartition it into several contiguous parts. Letpbe the number of these parts, whose boundaries are \r\n\r\n(l1,r1), (l2,r2), ... ,(lp,rp), which satisfyli=ri-1+ 1,li<=ri,l1= 1,rp=n. The parts themselves \r\n\r\nalso satisfy the following restrictions:For any two pairs (Ap,Bp), \r\n\r\n(Aq,Bq), where (Ap,Bp) is belongs to theTpth part and (Aq,Bq) theTqth part. IfTp<Tq, thenBp>Aq.LetMibe the maximumA-component of elements in theith part, sayMi= max\r\n\r\n{Ali,Ali+1...Ari}, 1 <=i<=pit is provided thatwhere Limit is a given integer.LetSibe the sum ofB-components of elements \r\n\r\nin theith part.Now I want to minimize the valuemax{Si:1 <=i<= \r\n\r\np}Could you tell me the minimum?InputThe input contains exactly one test case. The first line of input contains two positive integers N (N <= 50000), Limit \r\n\r\n(Limit <= 231-1). Then follow N lines each contains a positive integers pair (A,B). It's always \r\n\r\nguaranteed thatmax{A1,A2...An} <= LimitOutputOutput the minimum target value.ExampleInput:4 6\r\n4 3\r\n3 5\r\n2 5\r\n2 4Output:9ExplanationAn available assignment is the first two pairs are assigned into the first part and the last two pairs are assigned into \r\n\r\nthe second part. ThenB1>A3,B1>A4,B2>A3,B2>A4, max{A1,A2}+max{A3,A4} <= 6, and minimum max\r\n\r\n{B1+B2,B3+B4}=9.",
