  "text": "Leeana Learned Few New Things Few Days Ago, Like:Find The Summation Of Divisors.Modular Arithmetic.So Now Her Uncle Gave Her A Task.Task Is: You Will Be Given A Number(N) And Another Number(K).Now You Have To Find  KthPower Summation Of Divisors Of N.Summation Of All Divisors OfNWill Be Huge,  So You Have To Print The Summation Module (M=1000000007).Like: Divisors Of 6 is: ( 1 2 3 6 ) And K = 2.so, summation is: 1^K+2^K+3^K+6^K = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 6^2 = 1+4+9+36 = 50 % 1000000007 = 50Leeana Thinks That You Are A Great Programmer, So She Needs Your Help. Can You Help Her??? :D :D :DInputInput Starts With An Integer T (≤ 500), Denoting The Number Of Test Cases. Each Case Contains An Integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1015) And An Integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 105) Denoting The Power Of Divisors.OutputFor Each Test Cases, Print The Case Number And The Kth Power Summation  Of Divisors Of N Module 1000000007. After Each Case Print A New Line. See Sample Input And Output For Better Explanation.ExampleInput:4\r\n6 2\r\n6 1\r\n6 4\r\n6 3Output:Case 1: 50\r\nCase 2: 12\r\nCase 3: 1394\r\nCase 4: 252#Extra_Challenge: N<=10^18, T<=1000 TL: 1s",
