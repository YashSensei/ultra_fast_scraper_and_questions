  "text": "You're given a stringsconsisting of letters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.The matching function ms( i ) is defined as the number of matching characters ofsand its i-shift. In other words, ms( i ) is the number of characters that are matched when you align the 0-th character ofswith the i-th character of its copy.You are asked to compute the maximum of ms( i ) for all i ( 1 <= i <= |s| ). To make it a bit harder, you should also output all the optimal i's in increasing order.InputThe first and only line of input contains the strings. 2 <= |s| <= 105.OutputThe first line of output contains the maximal ms( i ) over all i.The second line of output contains all the i's for which ms( i ) reaches maximum.ExampleInput:caccacaaOutput:4\r\n3Explanation:caccacaacaccacaaThe underlined characters indicate the ones that match when shift = 3.",
