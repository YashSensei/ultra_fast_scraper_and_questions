  "text": "You are traveling by starship and at any time you are always moving in one of6directions: forwards, backwards, up, down, left, or right. In other words, during every second, one of the three coordinates of your position changes by exactly one unit. Let us suppose that you are at (x1,y1,z1) and you would like to reach (x2,y2,z2). Unfortunately, yours is only a first generation starship, which means that all movements are completely random, so at every second you will be moving with probability 1/6 forwards/backwards/up/down/left/right. Could you compute the probability that we will be at the destination in then-th second?InputThe first line contains integerT, representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a positive integer n, the next line gives the starting position of the starship, while the final one is the destination. It is known that:T< 30000,0< n â‰¤ 1000. The absolute value of thex, y, zcoordinates are smaller than 106. There are5input sets for10points.OutputTlines, and in thei-th line give the required probability for thei-th test case. Use10digits after the decimal point!ExampleInput:520 0 00 0 040 0 00 0 01002 -3 4-4 5 61002 -3 4-4 5 710000 0 00 0 0Output:0.16666666670.06944444440.00013893810.00000000000.0000208505",
