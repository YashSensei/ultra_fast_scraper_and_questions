  "text": "EnglishVietnameseIn the nearby kindergarten they recently made up an attractive game  of strength and agility that kids love. The surface for the game is a large flat area divided into N×N squares. The children lay large spongy cues onto the surface. The sides of the cubes are the same length as the sides of the squares. When a cube is put on  the surface, its sides are aligned with some square. A cube may be put  on another cube too. Kids enjoy building forts and hiding them, but they  always leave behind a huge mess. Because of this, prior to closing the  kindergarten, the teachers rearrange all the cubes so that they occupy  a rectangle on the surface, with exactly one cube on every square in the rectangle. In one moving, a cube is taken off the top of a square to the top of any other square.Write a program that, given the state of the surface, calculates the  smallest number of moves needed to arrange all cubes into a rectangle.InputThe first line contains the integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M ≤ N2),  the dimensions of the surface and the number of cubes currently on the  surface.Each of the following M lines contains two integers R and C (1 ≤ R, C ≤ N), the coordinates of the square that contains the cube.OutputOutput the smallest number of moves. A solution will always exist.SampleInput:4 3\r\n2 2\r\n4 4\r\n1 1Output:2Input:5 8\r\n2 2\r\n3 2\r\n4 2\r\n2 4\r\n3 4\r\n4 4\r\n2 3\r\n2 3Output:3In the second example, a cube is moved from (2, 3) to (3, 3), from (4, 2)\r\nto (2, 5) and from (4, 4) to (3, 5).",
