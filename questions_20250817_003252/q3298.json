Can you help him?InputThere are several test cases (about 100), please process till EOF.Each of the following lines contains an integern(1 ≤n≤ 20000) and a real numberp(0 ≤p≤ 1, with 6 digits after the decimal).OutputPlease print one line per case containing the desired answer. Any answer with an absolute error less than or equal to 10-2would be accepted. Please see the sample output for detailed format.ExampleInput:10 0.400000\r\n100 0.500000\r\n124 0.432650\r\n325 0.325100\r\n532 0.487520\r\n2276 0.720000Output:Case 1: 3.528175\r\nCase 2: 10.326044\r\nCase 3: 28.861945\r\nCase 4: 167.965476\r\nCase 5: 32.601816\r\nCase 6: 1390.500000",
