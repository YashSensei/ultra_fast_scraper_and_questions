  "text": "You are given a sequence A[1], A[2] ... A[N] (0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 108, 2 ≤ N ≤ 105). There are two types of operations and they are defined as follows:Update:This will be indicated in the input by a 'U' followed by space and then two integers i and x.U i x, 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 108.This operation sets the value of A[i] to x.Query:This will be indicated in the input by a 'Q' followed by a single space and then two integers i and j.Q x y, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ N.You must find i and j such that x ≤ i, j ≤ y and i ≠ j, such that the sum A[i]+A[j] is maximized. Print the sum A[i]+A[j].InputThe first line of input consists of an integerNrepresenting the length of the sequence. Next\r\nline consists of N space separated integers A[i]. Next line contains an integerQ, Q ≤ 105, representing the number of operations. Next Q lines contain the operations.OutputOutput the maximum sum mentioned above, in a separate line, for each Query.ExampleInput:5\r\n1 2 3 4 5\r\n6\r\nQ 2 4\r\nQ 2 5\r\nU 1 6\r\nQ 1 5\r\nU 1 7\r\nQ 1 5Output:7\r\n9\r\n11\r\n12Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
