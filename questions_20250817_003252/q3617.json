  "text": "There arenold trees planted along a road that goes from the top of a hill to its bottom. Local government decided to cut them down. In order not to waste wood each tree should be transported to a sawmill.Trees can be transported only in one direction: downwards. There is a sawmill at the lower end of the road. Two additional sawmills can be built along the road. You have to decide where to build them, as to minimize the cost of transportation. The transportation costs one cent per meter, per kilogram of wood.InputThe first line of the input contains one integern- the number of trees (2 ≤n≤ 20,000). The trees are numbered 1, 2, ...,n, starting from the top of the hill and going downwards. Each of the followingnlines contains two positive integers separated by single space. Linei + 1contains:wi- weight (in kilograms) of thei-th tree anddi- distance (in meters) between trees numberiandi + 1, 1 ≤wi≤ 10,000, 1 ≤di≤ 10,000. The last of these numbers,dn, is the distance from the tree numbernto the lower end of the road. It is guaranteed that the total cost of transporting all trees to the sawmill at the end of the road is less than 2,000,000,000 cents.OutputThe first and only line of output should contain one integer: the minimum cost of transportation.ExampleInput:9\r\n1 2\r\n2 1\r\n3 3\r\n1 1\r\n3 2\r\n1 6\r\n2 1\r\n1 2\r\n1 1Output:26",
