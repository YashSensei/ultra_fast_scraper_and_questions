  "text": "Given two vectors, a = (xa, ya), b = (xb, yb), their dot product is defined as follows:dp(a, b) = xa*xb+ ya*yb.Given N vectors in the plane, find a pair for each of them (among those given in the input) such that the dot product of the vector and its pair is maximal. You may pair a vector with itself too.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200000).Each of the next N lines contain a pair of real numbers, xiand yi(0 ≤ |xi|, |yi| ≤ 100000),representing the i-th vector. xiand yiwill be rounded to 3 decimal places.OutputOutput N lines, i-th one containing the maximal dot product for the i-th vector from the input rounded to 3 decimal places.ExampleInput:40.000 1.0000.000 2.0001.000 1.0000.000 0.000Output:2.0004.0002.0000.000Explanation:Pair the first vector with the second, the second with itself, third with itself or with the second, and the last one with any of them.",
