  "text": "Chiaki has a set $A$ of $n$ intervals, the $i$-th of them is $[l_i, r_i]$. She would like to know the number of such interval sets $S \\subset A$: for every interval $a \\in A$ which is not in $S$, there exists at least one interval $b$ in $S$ which has non-empty intersection with $a$. As this number may be very large, Chiaki is only interested in its remainder modulo $(10^9+7)$.Interval $a$ has intersection with interval $b$ if there exists a real number $x$ that $l_a \\le x \\le r_a$ and $l_b \\le x \\le r_b$.InputThere are multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer $T$, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\times 10^5$) -- the number of intervals.Each of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \\le l_i < r_i \\le 10^9$) denoting the $i$-th interval.It is guaranteed that for every $1 \\le i < j \\le n$, $l_i \\ne l_j$ or $r_i \\ne r_j$ and that the sum of $n$ in all test cases does not exceed $2 \\times 10^5$.OutputFor each test case, output an integer denoting the answer.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n1 2\r\n3 4\r\n5 6\r\n3\r\n1 4\r\n2 4\r\n3 4Output:1\r\n7",
