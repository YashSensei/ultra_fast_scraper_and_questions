  "text": "N points are given in a plane. Any point has integer coordinates and no\r\ntwo points have the same x coordinates or the same y coordinates.\r\nA pair of points A and B uniquely define a rectangle R(A,B) whose sides\r\nare parallel to coordinate axes such that the points A and B are endpoints\r\nof one of its diagonals. A pair of two given points A and B are  very visible\r\nif there are  no other given points within a rectangle R(A,B). A pair of points\r\nconsists of two different points and in this problem pairs (A,B) and (B,A)\r\nare regarded to be the same pair and are counted as one pair.At the beginning a coordinate plane has no given points. Your program should read\r\ncoordinates of the given points and after reading coordinates of a point,\r\nit should write number of pairs of currently very visible given points.InputFirst line of input contains an integer N, 2 ≤ N ≤ 5000, the number of given points.\r\nEach of the following N lines contains two integers X, Y, 0  ≤ X,Y  ≤ 10^6,\r\ncoordinates of the given points in the order they should be added to the plane.OutputAn output should contain N lines, kth  line should contain a number\r\nof pairs of very visible given points after taking kth\r\ngiven point into account.Sampleinput7\r\n1 5\r\n2 7\r\n3 8\r\n5 1\r\n6 2\r\n7 3\r\n4 4output0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n5\r\n9\r\n13\r\n10input4\r\n2 3\r\n3 4\r\n1 2\r\n4 1output0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n5",
