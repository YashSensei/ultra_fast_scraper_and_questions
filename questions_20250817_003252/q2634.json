  "text": "Radar scanned the approaching enemy aircraft on the border. However due to some error part of the transmitted data can't be deciphered. It was possible only to obtain the coefficients of the cubic polynomial, whose roots are the coordinates of the aircraft relative to the radar. Now you need to calculate the distance to the aircraft. Write the program to solve this task.InputThe first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) - number\r\ntests. The next T lines contain three integers a, b and c - coefficients of the polynomialx3+ax2+bx+c, whose roots are the coordinates\r\n(the absolute value of the coordinates do not exceed 108).OutputFor each test print the square of the distance to the enemy aircraft.ExampleInput:1\r\n-6 11 -6Output:14",
