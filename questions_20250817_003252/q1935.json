  "text": "Feluda likes strings and mathematics very much. As Feluda is still a child, he was only recently introduced to concept of powers. Being a novice guy, he thinks about powering strings as well as numbers. He defines A^n (A powered to n) to be A + A + ... + A which is a concatenation of n copies of A. For example \"bhupkas\"^2 = \"bhupkasbhupkas\".He wants to check if given two strings A and B, can he find such positive integers n and m so that A ^ n = B ^ m. We are only interested in YES/NO answer, no need to give n and m values.InputFirst line contains integer T: number of test cases (T <= 100).Single line per test case containing strings A and B. Both will be non-empty, of lengths of at most 10^5, composed only of lower case letters.OutputFor each test case, output \"YES\" if it possible to find integers n and m so that A ^ n = B ^ m or \"NO\" otherwise (quotes for clarity).ExampleInput:3\r\na a\r\nab ba\r\npraveen praveenOutput:YES\r\nNO\r\nYES",
