  "text": "This problem is a higher constraints version ofKWACIK(Polish).You are given a 3x3 grid. You can place an integerm(a≤m≤b) in each cell.How many ways are there to place integers in the cells such that the sum of each 2x2 subgrid isn?InputThe first line contains an integerT(1 ≤T≤ 100), the number of test cases.On each of the nextTlines, you are given three integersa,bandn. (0 ≤a≤b≤ 500, 0 ≤n≤ 2000)OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to place integers.ExampleInput:1\r\n1 2 5Output:8ExplanationThere are 8 ways to place integers fora=1,b=2 andn=5.2 1 2 : 2 1 2 : 2 1 1 : 1 2 1 : 1 2 1 : 1 1 2 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 1\r\n1 1 1 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 2 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 1 : 2 1 1 : 2 1 2 : 1 2 1\r\n2 1 2 : 1 2 1 : 2 1 1 : 2 1 2 : 1 2 1 : 1 1 2 : 1 1 1 : 1 1 1Information- There are 7 input files.- Changed the time limit of the input file #7 to 20 seconds and rejudged all submissions.
