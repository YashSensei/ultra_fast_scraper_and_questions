  "text": "Arya and Bran are playing a game. Initially, two positive integersAandBare written on a blackboard. The players take turns, starting with Arya. On his or her turn, a player can replaceAwithA-k*Bfor any positive integerk, or replaceBwithB-k*Afor any positive integerk. The first person to make one of the numbers drop to zero or below loses.For example, if the numbers are initially (12, 51), the game might progress as follows:Arya replaces 51 with 51 - 3*12 = 15, leaving (12, 15) on the blackboard.Bran replaces 15 with 15 - 1*12 = 3, leaving (12, 3) on the blackboard.Arya replaces 12 with 12 - 3*3 = 3, leaving (3, 3) on the blackboard.Bran replaces one 3 with 3 - 1*3 = 0, and loses.We will say (A,B) is awinningposition if Arya can always win a game that starts with (A,B) on the blackboard, no matter what Bran does.Given four integersA1,A2,B1,B2, count how many winning positions (A,B) there are withA1≤A≤A2andB1≤B≤B2.InputThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Ttest cases follow, one per line. Each line contains the four integersA1,A2,B1,B2, separated by spaces.1 ≤T≤ 250.1 ≤A1≤A2≤ 1,000,000.1 ≤B1≤B2≤ 1,000,000.A2-A1≤ 999,999.B2-B1≤ 999,999.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing \"Case #x: y\", where x is the case number (starting from 1), and y is the number of winning positions (A,B) withA1≤A≤A2andB1≤B≤B2.ExampleInput:35 5 8 811 11 2 21 6 1 6Output:Case #1: 0Case #2: 1Case #3: 20",
