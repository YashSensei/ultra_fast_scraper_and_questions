You have tocount the total lengthof allWOWsubstrings.WOWsubstrings are defined as a contiguous substring of a string where there is not any character occurring more than one times. That means, all the characters of substring are unique.As the answer could be very large, print it modulo100007. (Note: 100007 isnota prime number.)InputInput starts with an integerT, denoting the number of test cases. Each case starts with a stringS. All the characters in the string will be lowercase letters of the English alphabet.OutputFor each case, print the case number and total length of all WOW substrings of given string modulo100007.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 50.1 ≤ |S| ≤ 500000.
