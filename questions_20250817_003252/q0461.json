  "text": "Two positive integers (without any leading zeroes) are said to be anagrams of each other if the digits in one integer (in decimal notation) can be rearranged to form the other.For any positive integerX, defineAXas the set of all positive integers that are anagrams ofX. Note that the setAXcontains at least one element:X.For any positive integerN, defineSNas the set of all positive integersY, such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers inAYis equal toN.You are given the integerN. Your task is to find the minimum element ofSN, or report that set is empty.InputSeveral test cases, the number of them is less than 2023. Each test case consists of a single line with a positive integerNwithout any leading zeroes. The number of digits inNdoesn't exceed 1000.Input terminates by EOF.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum element ofSNin a single line. IfSNis empty, output -1 instead.Solve this problem by at most 0.5KB of source code.ExampleInput:12\r\n2023Output:48\r\n-1",
