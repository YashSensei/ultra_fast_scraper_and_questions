  "text": "Story:\r\nTwilight Sparkle was working on some formulas when she came across a strange pattern.When she added 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ..., she saw that it kept getting closer and closer to 1.She was able to figure out that problem and a few more, but there are others that are too difficult.  She needs your help.Problem StatementGiven k and r, integers, findSum from n = 1 to infinity of n^k / r^n.Also you must output the exact value, as a fraction in lowest terms.InputYou will be given a number T on the first line.  The following T lines will be of the formS k rwhere S is a String label with no spaces, and both k and r are as described above.OutputYour output will contain T lines of the formS N / Dwhere S is the label you were given in the input, N is the numerator of the answer, and D is the denominator.  D may be 1.To be more precise, if the fraction is negative, then output the negative sign next to N.ExampleInput:6\r\nCase1: 0 2\r\nCase2: 0 3\r\nCase3: 0 -3\r\nLabel: 2 9\r\nOtherlabel: 12 16\r\nBiggest: 50 -555Output:Case1: 1 / 1\r\nCase2: 1 / 2\r\nCase3: -1 / 4\r\nLabel: 45 / 256\r\nOtherlabel: 268201436794928 / 320361328125\r\nBiggest: -71542844799237379223056641850683038399677651990786654293842285446351016224553939010882650681431892067495137019178862799169155069446928707568453465 /708605590708315484115807367753335917996473252333345569546511090260650714823008759459320274728690683789654784801111318621847552Note: The output for each case should all be on one line.  It is split in the final case here for readability.BoundsT <= 100000 <= k <= 501 < |r| <= 1000The timelimit per case is ~x5 my Java solution.",
