  "text": "Given an array A having n elements, let X be the maximum sum of any contiguous sequence in the array. How many contiguous sequences in A sum up to X?InputThe first line contains T the number of test cases. There follow 2T lines, 2 for each test case. The first line contains the n, the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n space separated integers Ai.OutputOutput T lines, one for each test case. On each line, output two space separated integers; the maximum sequence sum, and the number of sequences which obtain this maximum sum.ExampleInput:23-1 -1 -142 0 -2 2Output:-1 32 4Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 351 ≤ n ≤ 100000-1000 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000",
