  "text": "Consider a N * N * N lattice. One corner is at (0, 0, 0) and the opposite one is at (N, N, N). How many lattice points are visible from corner at (0, 0, 0)? A point X is visible from point Y iff no other lattice point lies on the segment joining X and Y.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. The next T lines contain an integer N.OutputOutput T lines, one corresponding to each test case.SampleInput:3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n5Sample Output:7\r\n19\r\n175ConstraintsT <= 501 <= N <= 1000000",
