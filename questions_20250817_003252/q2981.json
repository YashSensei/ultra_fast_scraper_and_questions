  "text": "You are given a 2D grid with each cell containing a letter, you have to start at any point and move either up, down, left and right to create the word \"ALCATRAZ\" by picking up lettersin order. After choosing a letter, it gets removed and leaves the cell empty. You have to determine the minimum number of moves needed to do so.Input2 space separated integers N, M (number of rows and columns respectively.)1 ≤ N, M ≤ 500Then next N lines gives the details of the maze.OutputThe shortest path as described in the above problem.Print \"IMPOSSIBLE\" (without quotes) if you can't make that word.ExampleInput:4 5\r\nAZCLT\r\nAARAL\r\nSJATC\r\nLARAZOutput:9Path is as follows: 2, 4 → 2, 5 → 3, 5 → 3, 4 → 3, 3 → 3, 4 → 4, 4 → 4, 3 → 4, 4 → 4, 5",
