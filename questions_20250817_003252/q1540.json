First digit can be anything from 1 to 9.Find the number of nice sequences of length n.InputInput consists of number of test cases tFollowing t lines have a single line containing n as described in the problem statement.OutputPrint the number of nice sequences of length n modulo 1000000007 in a separate line.ExampleInput2\r\n1\r\n2Output9\r\n23ExplanationFor n=2 nice sequences are: 10, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 33, 36, 39, 40, 44, 48 and so on!Constraints1 ≤ n ≤ 1000",
