  "text": "You are given a simple task.Given a sequence A[i] with N numbers such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N. You have to perform Q operations on a given set of numbers.Operations:A V l, Add the value V to element with index l.R a l r, Replace all the elements of sequence with index i such that l ≤ i ≤ r with a.Q l r, Print the number of elements with index i such that l ≤ i ≤ r and A[i] is prime number and A[i] ≤ 107.No number in the sequence ever will exceed 109.Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 1051 ≤ Q ≤ 105V ≤ 103A[i] ≤ 108a ≤ 1071 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N.InputFirst line contains N as number of sequence elements and Q as number of operations to be performed. Second line contains N initial elements of the sequence. After that each of the next Q lines contains one operation to be performed on the sequence.OutputPrint each value in newline as stated above.ExampleInput:5 10\r\n1 2 3 4 5\r\nA 3 1\r\nQ 1 3\r\nR 5 2 4\r\nA 1 1\r\nQ 1 1\r\nQ 1 2\r\nQ 1 4\r\nA 3 5\r\nQ 5 5\r\nQ 1 5Output:2\r\n1\r\n2\r\n4\r\n0\r\n4",
