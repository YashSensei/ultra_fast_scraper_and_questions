  "text": "You are on vacation on a drunken island, but you couldn't resist the temptation of solving a good old problem. It all started when a group of kids played a game they call \"The Falling Coconuts\". In this game, a number of coconuts fall to the ground, one by one, on a single axis, at the locations given in drops. If a coconut X lands on the ground, it remains where it is. If it lands on top of another coconut Y, one of the following things happens:If coconut Y is surrounded on both sides by coconuts (denoted by 'O'), coconut X remains where it is.X\r\n    OYOIf there is no coconut directly to the right of coconut Y, coconut X slides down to the position directly to the right of coconut Y.X\r\n    OY   ->  OYXX\r\n     Y   ->   YXIf there is a coconut directly to the right of coconut Y, but no coconut directly to the left of coconut Y, coconut X slides down to the position directly to the left of coconut Y.X\r\n    YO  ->  XYOEach time coconut X slides down to a different position, it will continue to slide (following the behavior outlined above) until it's in a place where it will not slide any further.The task is to display the final coconut configuration.InputFirst line is t = number of test cases.Each test case consists of 2 lines, first line containing the number of coconuts and second line contains n integers denoting the position of each coconut on the x-axis.OutputAs described in the problem statement.ExampleInput:2\r\n8\r\n8 9 10 11 12 8 12 10\r\n10\r\n6 8 10 7 9 8 8 8 8 8Output:---O---\r\nOOOOOOO\r\n--O---\r\n-OOO--\r\nOOOOOOExplanation of test case 1The configuration after each fallen coconut is given below:X →  OX  →  OOX  →  000X  →  0000X  →  X00000  →  000000X  →  0000000In this diagram, 'X' denotes the last fallen coconut.",
