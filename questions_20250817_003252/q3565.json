If there're more than one solution, print the one lexicographically smallest. If there's no solution, print \"Impossible\".Q = 1\r\nNi = 4\r\nA1 = 16\r\n{ 42+ 02+ 02+ 02= 16}InputThere's an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 105) in the first line; it stands for the number of queries. The next Q lines describe each query with two integers Ni, Ai (1 ≤ Ai ≤ 105, 4 ≤ Ni ≤ 100). Ni is the number of integers that you need to find whose sum of squares is equal to Ai.OutputYou have to print Q lines, each one with Ni numbers such that the sum of squares is equal to Ai. If there's no solution, you've to print \"Impossible\".ExampleInput:1\r\n4 16Output:0 0 0 4Input:1\r\n4 15Output:1 1 2 3",
