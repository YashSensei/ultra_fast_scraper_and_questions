  "text": "Given the value of N, you will have to find the value of H. The meaning of H is given in the following code:H=0;For (i=1; i<=n; i++) {For (j=1; j<=n; j++) {H = H + totient(i) * totient(j);}}Totientor phi function, φ(n) is an arithmetic function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. That is, if n is a positive integer, then φ(n) is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which gcd(n, k) = 1Constraints0 < T ≤ 500 < N ≤ 104InputThe first line contains T, the number of test cases. It is followed by T lines each containing a number N .OutputFor each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value of H for the corresponding N.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n10Output:16\r\n1024",
