  "text": "You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) withNnodes, and edges numbered 1, 2, 3...N-1.We will ask you to perform some instructions of the following form:CHANGE i ti: change the cost of the i-th edge to tiorQUERY a b: ask for the maximum edge cost on the path from node a to node bInputThe first line of input contains an integert, the number of test cases (t≤ 20). t test cases follow.For each test case:In the first line there is an integerN(N≤ 10000),In the nextN-1 lines, the i-th line describes the i-th edge: a line with three integersa b cdenotes an edge betweena,bof costc(c≤ 1000000),The next lines contain instructions\"CHANGE i ti\"or\"QUERY a b\",The end of each test case is signified by the string \"DONE\".There is one blank line between successive tests.OutputFor each \"QUERY\" operation, write one integer representing its result.ExampleInput:1\r\n\r\n3\r\n1 2 1\r\n2 3 2\r\nQUERY 1 2\r\nCHANGE 1 3\r\nQUERY 1 2\r\nDONEOutput:1\r\n3",
