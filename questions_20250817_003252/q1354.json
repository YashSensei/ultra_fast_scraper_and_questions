  "text": "You will be given n positive integers a1, a2... an. We say that a non-negative integer combination of these numbers is of the form a1*b1+ a2*b2+ ... + an*bnwhere each of b1, b2... bnis a non-negative integer. You are to determine how many positive integers cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of a1, a2... an.InputThe first line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases (about 30). Each test case consists of a single line. The first integer on the line is n, between 1 and 30, which indicates the number of integers a1, a2... an. Then n integers follow each between 1 and 100, 000. The i'th such integer is ai. All integers on this line are separated by a space.OutputFor each test case you are to output a single line. If there are only a finite number of positive integers that cannot be expressed as a non-negative integer combination of a1, a2... an, then you are to output this number. Otherwise, simply output the text \"Infinite\" (without quotes).Constraints1 <= n <= 301 <= ai<= 100000ExampleInput:3\r\n2 2 4\r\n2 4 5\r\n3 11 12 13Output:Infinite\r\n6\r\n30ExplanationSample Test 2:You cannot express 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 11 using only the integers 4 and 5.",
