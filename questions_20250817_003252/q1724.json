  "text": "On the side of the road, there are palm trees, there's a bar, there's shadow, there's something more. In this problem, we are particularly interested in the palm trees.Ana, Adan, Alan and Amanda organized a trip: while Ana and Adan where dealing with petty things like checking the car, preparing the luggage and finding a place to stay, Alan and Amanda dedicated themselves to the most important part: studying the views of palm trees to which they would have access to while on the road.The road they are now driving on is completely straight, and in this problem we will represent it by theY = 0line of theXYplane. On the side of the road with coordinatesY > 0there are palm trees, which we will represent by different points of theXYplane with positiveYcoordinate. Alan and Amanda have noticed that from each point on the road certain palm trees are visible, and in general these vary along the road. A palm tree is said to be visible from a point on the road if and only if the segment that joins both points does not go through any other palm tree.In the following figure the unfilled circles represent palm trees in the first sample input, whereas the filled ones represent some possible points on the road.From pointpthe palm trees that are visible area,bandd, since palm treecis hidden behind palm treea. From pointqthe visible palm trees area,candd, since palm treebis now hidden behind palm treea. From pointrall the palm trees are visible, and from pointsonly palm treesaanddare visible, since palm treesbandcare hidden behind palm treed.While Ana and Adan take turns to drive the car, Alan and Amanda discuss the benefits of knowing how many visible quantities of palm trees there are. Given a set of palm trees, an integer numbermis a visible quantity of palm trees if and only if there exists at least one point on the road (i.e. a point with coordinateY = 0) from which exactlympalm trees are visible.In the example illustrated above,2,3and4are visible quantities of palm trees, as can be respectively testified by pointss,pandron the road. On the other hand,0and1are not visible quantities, because from every point of the road at least2palm trees are visible. Finally, nom > 4is a visible quantity, since there are only4palm trees in total. Therefore, in this example there are3visible quantities of palm trees. (Note that ifmis a visible quantity of palm trees, there could be more than one point on the road that testifies to this situation; in the previous example this is the case with pointspandqfor the visible quantity3, as well as with infinitely many other points along withrfor visible quantity4.)Ana and Adan are getting tired. They want Alan and Amanda to let go of the palm trees and at least prepare some sandwiches. For that reason, you need to make a program to calculate how many different visible quantities of palm trees there are along the road.InputThe first line contains an integer numberNindicating the number of palm trees that there are on the side of the road (1 ≤ N≤1000). Each of the followingNlines describes a different palm tree using two integer numbersXandY, representing the coordinates of said palm tree in theXYplane (1≤X, Y≤105). There are no two palm trees that share the same position.OutputPrint a single line containing an integer number representing the number of visible quantities of palm trees that there are along the road.Example 1Input:4\r\n2 1\r\n3 1\r\n3 2\r\n3 3Output:3Example 2Input:7\r\n2 1\r\n3 1\r\n4 1\r\n1 2\r\n3 2\r\n5 2\r\n3 3Output:4",
