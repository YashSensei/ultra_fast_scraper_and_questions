  "text": "Kutus loves even number. Girl friend of Kutus, name Putus makes an interesting problem for Kutus to testing his even number knowledge. Putus gives an integer array A, consisting of N number.Putus asked Kutus to process the following three types of queries on this array accurately and efficiently.0 X V: add V to the Xth element of array. i.e. AX = AX + V.1 L R V: replace all the element in range L to R with V.2 L R: Find out whether all elements frequency in the range L to R is/are even or notInputInput start with an integer T, which denotes the number of test case. Each case contains 2 space separated integer N and Q denoting the size of array A and the number of queries to be performed.Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A. Each of the next Q lines of input contains a query having one of the mentioned three types. There will be no more than fifty update operation (type 0 and type 1).OutputFor each case print the case number and print the answer. If all elements frequency in the range L to R is/are even, then answer will be ‘Yes’ otherwise answer will be ‘No’.ConstraintsT <= 101 <= N <= 1000001 <= Q <= 1000000 <= Ai , V <= 1000001 <= L <= R <= NExampleInput:1\r\n5 6\r\n1 2 2 3 2\r\n2 2 3\r\n0 5 1\r\n2 2 5\r\n2 1 5\r\n1 1 3 2\r\n2 1 5Output:Case 1:\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nNo",
