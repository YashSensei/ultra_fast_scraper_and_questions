  "text": "A number is said to be a 369 number if:The count of 3s is equal to the count of 6s and the count of 6s is equal to the count of 9s.The count of 3s is at least 1.For Example 12369, 383676989, 396 all are 369 numbers whereas 213, 342143, 111 are not.Given A and B find how many 369 numbers are there in the interval [A, B]. Print the answer modulo 1000000007.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases (T) followed by T lines each containing 2 integers A and B.OutputFor each test case output the number of 369 numbers between A and B inclusive.ConstraintsT ≤ 1001 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1050ExampleInput:3\r\n121 4325\r\n432 4356\r\n4234 4325667Output:60\r\n58\r\n207159",
