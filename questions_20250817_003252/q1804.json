  "text": "One of the traps we will encounter in the Pyramid is located in the Large Room.\r\nA lot of small holes are drilled into the floor. They look completely harmless\r\nat the first sight. But when activated, they start to throw out very\r\nhot java, uh ... pardon, lava. Unfortunately, all known paths to the Center\r\nRoom (where the Sarcophagus is) contain a trigger that activates the\r\ntrap. The ACM were not able to avoid that. But they have carefully monitored\r\nthe positions of all the holes. So it is important to find the place in the\r\nLarge Room that has the maximal distance from all the holes. This place is\r\nthe safest in the entire room and the archaeologist has to hide there.InputThe input consists ofTtest cases. The number of them (T) is\r\ngiven on the first line of the input file.  Each test case begins with a\r\nline containing three integersX,Y,Mseparated by space. The numbers\r\nsatisfy conditions:1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10000,1 ≤ M ≤ 1000. The\r\nnumbersXandYindicate the dimensions of the Large\r\nRoom which has a rectangular\r\nshape. The numberMstands for the number of holes. Then exactlyMlines\r\nfollow, each containing two integer numbersUiandVi(0 ≤ Ui≤ X,0 ≤ Vi≤ Y) indicating the coordinates of one\r\nhole. There may be several holes at the same position.OutputPrint exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain the\r\nsentence \"The safest point is (P,Q).\"\r\nwherePandQare the coordinates of the point in the\r\nroom that has the maximum\r\ndistance from the nearest hole, rounded to the nearest number with exactly\r\none digit after the decimal point (0.05 rounds up to 0.1).ExampleInput:3\r\n1000 50 1\r\n10 10\r\n100 100 4\r\n10 10\r\n10 90\r\n90 10\r\n90 90\r\n3000 3000 4\r\n1200 85\r\n63 2500\r\n2700 2650 \r\n2990 100Output:The safest point is (1000.0, 50.0).\r\nThe safest point is (50.0, 50.0).\r\nThe safest point is (1433.0, 1669.8).",
