  "text": "You are givenN (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000)integers. Each integer is square free (meaning it has no divisor which is a square number except 1) and all the prime factors are less than 50. You have to find out the number of pairs are there such that their GCD is 1 or a prime number. Note that (i, j) and (j, i) are different pairs if i and j are different.InputThe first line contains an integerT (1 ≤ T ≤ 10), the number of tests. Then T tests follows. First line of each tests contain an integerN. The next line followsNintegers.OutputPrintTlines. In each line print the required result.ExampleInput:1\r\n3\r\n2 1 6Output:8Explanationgcd(1, 2) = 1gcd(2, 1) = 1gcd(2, 6) = 2, a prime numbergcd(6, 2) = 2, a prime numbergcd(1, 6) = 1gcd(6, 1) = 1gcd(2, 2) = 2, a prime numbergcd(1, 1) = 1So, total of 8 pairs.Problem Setter: Nafis Sadique, Jahangirnagar University",
