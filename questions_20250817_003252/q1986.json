  "text": "Vertu was very impressed by the golden ratio φ=(1+√5)/2 and about it occurring in nature and all that. He now begins to wonder if any non negative integral power of φ is also special. Since he does not like working with decimals, he decided to approximate the positive integral power of φ to its closest integer. Help him by printing the closest integer to φn, givenn.InputThe first line containsT, the number of test cases.Tlines follow, each containing one positive integern.OutputFor each of these integers, print the closest integer to φn. \r\nIf you think there are two closest possible integers, print either of them. \r\nPrint the answer modulo (109+7).ConstraintsT≤ 1000000 ≤n≤ 109ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n3Output:2\r\n4",
