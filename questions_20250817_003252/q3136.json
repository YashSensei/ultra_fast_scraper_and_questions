  "text": "You are given a positive integer N. Let us consider set A of fractions x/y where 0 ≤ x/y ≤ 1, y ≤ N and the maximum common divisor of x and y is 1.For example N = 5. Set A in increasing order consists of elements 0/1; 1/5; 1/4; 1/3; 2/5; 1/2; 3/5; 2/3; 3/4; 4/5; 1/1.Your task is to find the i-th smallest fraction in set A.InputThe first line of input contains the number of testcases t (t ≤ 15). The first line of each testcase contains numbers N and M (N ≤ 5000, M ≤ 10000). The next M lines contain one question each.OutputFor each testcase, you should output M lines which are the answers to the M questions.ExampleInput:1\r\n5 4\r\n1\r\n3\r\n5\r\n8Output:0/1\r\n1/4\r\n2/5\r\n2/3",
