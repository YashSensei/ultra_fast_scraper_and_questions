You are now to do\nsomething completely different.Given a DNA string S from the alphabet {A,C,G,T}, find the\nminimal number of copy operations needed to create another string\nT. You may reverse the strings you copy, and copy both from S\nand the pieces of your partial T. You may put these pieces together\nat any time. You may only copy contiguous parts of your partial\nT, and all copied strings must be used in your final T.Example:\nFrom S = “ACTG” create T = “GTACTATTATA”Get GT......... by copying and reversing “TG” from S.Get GTAC....... by copying “AC” from S.Get GTAC...TA.. by copying “TA” from the partial T.Get GTAC...TAAT by copying and reversing “TA” from the partial T.Get GTACAATTAAT by copying “AAT” from the partial T.InputThe first line of input gives a single integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, the number of test cases. Then\nfollow, for each test case, a line with the string S of length 1 ≤ m ≤ 18, and a line with\nthe string T of length 1 ≤ n ≤ 18.OutputOutput for each test case the number of copy operations needed to create T from S, or\n“impossible” if it cannot be done.ExampleInput5\nACGT\nGTAC\nA\nC\nACGT\nTGCA\nACGT\nTCGATCGA\nA\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOutput2\nimpossible\n1\n4\n6",
