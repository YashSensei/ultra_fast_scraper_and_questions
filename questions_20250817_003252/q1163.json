All you have to do is to count all triangles in the biggest one (Level N).InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T (T ≤ 10000) - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 106) which is the level of the triangle in that test case.OutputFor each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles in the biggest one (Level N). (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit integer)ExampleInput:3123Output:1513Source limit is 500 bytes.",
