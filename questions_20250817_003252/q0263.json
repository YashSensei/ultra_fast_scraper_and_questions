  "text": "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of units that has the property of reading the same in either direction, e.g. 'racecar', 'solos'.TaskYou are given a number k (2 ≤ k ≤ 30000) and a non-empty string S whose length does not exceed 30000 lowercase  letters.We say two palindromes are different when they start from different positions. How many different palindromes of the length k does S contains?InputThe first line contains  K. The second line contains S. K does not exceed the length of S.OutputThe first and only line should consist of a single number - the number of palindromes found.ExampleInput:5\r\nabababOutput:2",
