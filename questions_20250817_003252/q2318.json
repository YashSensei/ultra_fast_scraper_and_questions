  "text": "Progressive climate change has forced the Byteburg authorities to build a huge lightning conductor that would protect all the buildings within the city. These buildings form a row along a single street, and are numbered from1ton.The heights of the buildings and the lightning conductor are non-negative integers. Byteburg's limited funds allow construction of only a single lightning conductor. Moreover, as you would expect, the higher it will be, the more expensive.The lightning conductor of heightplocated on the roof of the buildingi(of heighthi) protects the buildingj(of heighthj) if the following inequality holds:hj≤ hi+ p - sqrt(|i - j|)where|i - j|denotes the absolute value of the difference betweeniandj.Byteasar, the mayor of Byteburg, asks your help. Write a program that, for every building, determines the minimum height of a lightning conductor that would protect all the buildings if it were put on top of the buildingi.InputIn the first line of the standard input there is a single integern(1 ≤ n ≤ 500,000) that denotes the number of buildings in Byteburg. Each of the followingnlines holds a single integerhi(1 ≤ hi≤ 1,000,000,000) that denotes the height of thei-th building.OutputYour program should print out exactlynlines to the standard output. Thei-th line should give a non-negative integerpidenoting the minimum height of the lightning conductor on thei-th building.ExampleInput:6\r\n5\r\n3\r\n2\r\n4\r\n2\r\n4Output:2\r\n3\r\n5\r\n3\r\n5\r\n4",
