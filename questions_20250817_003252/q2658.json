  "text": "It was Arbor Day. Alice implemented anRB-tree, Bob composed asegment tree, I made abinary tree- we all have a bright outlook.Lambda is always making mistakes while implementing segment trees (See his history of submissions). He then decides to draw a \"segment tree\". He putsnpoints on a plane, link certain pairs of them to form segments and all the segments form a tree. As a normal tree, it satisfies the following conditions:Consider points as vertices, segments as edges, it forms arooted tree.Each nodeuisstrictly higherthan its parent, namelyyu>yparent_of_u.Segments may only intersect on their endpoints.Lambda wants to minimize the total length of segments.The tree can be rotated to satisfy above conditions.InputFirst line of input contains single integern(1 ≤n≤ 500).Nextnlines each contain two integersxi,yidenoting the coordinate ofi-th point (0 ≤xi,yi≤ 1000). Points are distinct.OutputThe one and only line contains a real number representing the minimum length.Your answer must be rounded up to 4 digits after the decimal point.Example 1Input:6\r\n0 1\r\n1 0\r\n2 1\r\n4 1\r\n5 0\r\n6 1Output:7.6569IllustrationInput:10\r\n0 0\r\n0 1\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n1 4\r\n3 4\r\n-1 2\r\n-2 3\r\n-1 4\r\n-3 4Output:12.3137IllustrationThis is just a sample test case.
