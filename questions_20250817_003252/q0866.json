  "text": "Halum has been elected as the captain of his school's football team. To celebrate this, he is going to throw a party. Halum bought candies ofNdifferent flavors for the party. There areainumber of candies of theithflavor where(1 ≤ i ≤ N). To satisfy a guest he has to give him/her some positive number of candies of at leastKdifferent flavors. Otherwise the guest is not satisfied. Given this information now you have to find the maximum number of guests Halum can satisfy with the available candies.InputFirst line of the input contains an integerT (1 ≤ T ≤ 200), denoting the number of test cases.Tcases follow.First line of each case contains two integersNandK(1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1000).Nspace separated integersa1, a2… aNfollow in the next line(0 ≤ ai≤ 10^9). Theithof these integersaidenotes the number of candies ofithflavor(1 ≤ i ≤ N).OutputFor each case print one line containing \"Case X: Y\" (without the quotes) whereXis the case number starting from1andYis an integer denoting the maximum number of guests who can be satisfied.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 3\r\n1 2 3\r\n3 1\r\n1 2 3\r\n3 2\t\t\r\n3 2 4Output:Case 1: 1\r\nCase 2: 6\r\nCase 3: 4",
