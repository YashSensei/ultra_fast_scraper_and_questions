  "text": "A graph initially consists of N  (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) unconnected vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N.Your task is to maintain that graph and answer connectivity queries.All edges in the problem areundirected.You will receive the following queries, where (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N) :addA B : add an edge between  vertices  A and B, where initially there is no edge between A and B.remA B : remove edge between  vertices  A and B, where initially there is an edge between A and B.connA B : printYESif there is a path between A and B andNOotherwise, where A and B are different.InputThe first line of input contains the number of vertices N and the number of queries M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100,000). The following M lines contain queries.OutputFor eachconnquery outputYESorNO. Pay attention to letter case.ExampleInput:4 11add 1 2add 2 3add 3 4add 1 4conn 4 2rem 1 2conn 2 4rem 3 4conn 4 2add 2 4conn 4 2Output:YESYESNOYESThis example will be the first test case.",
