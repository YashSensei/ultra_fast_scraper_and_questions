At the beginning of the game, you havenprobes, a nexus and almost unlimited number of pylons. You can build a probe in the nexus per 3 Starcraft time units (STs), and this will cost youzunits of minerals. A probe can gatherxunits of minerals oryunits of gas per ST. What's the minimum time to getAunits of minerals andBunits of gas, if you build probes at nexus only and don't build any buildings?Assume that in the current map there are almost unlimited mineral fields and unlimited vespene geysers, and on each vespene geyser, a Protoss Assimilator has been built successfully.InputMultiple test cases, the number of them is given in the very first line.Each test case contains one line with 6 positive integersn,x,y,z,A,Bseparated by one space. All numbers in the input file will be less than 21.OutputFor each test case, output one line, which contains a single integer, the minimum time in ST.ExampleInput:\r\n1\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6Output:5",
