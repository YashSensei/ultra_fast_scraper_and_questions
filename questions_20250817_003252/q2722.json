  "text": "Given an array of size n, you need to reduce the array. In one step, remove any two elements from the array and add their sum instead. Continue addition and removal until no further reduction possible. Output the minimum cost of reduction possible for the given array.InputFirst line contains a positive integer T representing number of test cases.Next line contains a number n denoting the size of array.Next line contains N space separated positive integers (A[i])1 ≤ T ≤ 501 ≤ n ≤ 1061 ≤ A[i] ≤ 106OutputOutput minimum cost of reduction.ExampleInput:2\r\n4\r\n1 6 3 20\r\n3\r\n2 2 2Output:44\r\n10Explanation:Example 1:Remove {1,3} and insert 1+3=4, array becomes [4 6 20], cost=1+3=4Next remove {4,6} and insert 4+6=10, array becomes [10 20], cost=4+6=10 and overall cost=4+10=14Next remove {10,20} and insert 10+20=30, array becomes [30], cost=10+20=30 and overall cost=14+30=44Array cannot be reduced further, hence reduction cost is 44. This sequence of reduction also gives the minimum possible cost. You will see all other sequences give greater or equal cost.Example 2:Remove {2,2} and insert 2+2=4, array becomes [4 2 ], cost=2+2=4Next remove {4,2} and insert 4+2=6, array becomes [6], cost=4+2=6 and overall cost=4+6=10Array cannot be reduced further, hence reduction cost is 10.",
