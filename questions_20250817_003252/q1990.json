  "text": "Given 3 distinct circles with positive integer radiusR1,R2, andR3, and arranged like in the picture below:Now, your task is to compute radius of small circle that can be created like yellow circle in the picture above. All circles in the picture above tangent each other.InputThe first line in the input data, there is an integerT(0 <Tâ‰¤ 103) denoting number of test cases, thanTlines follow.For each lines, there are three integerR1,R2, andR3, (0 < {R1,R2,R3} < 109) denoting radius of each circle like in the picture above.OutputFor each test case, output radius of small circle that can be made, like in the picture above. Any output with absolute error less than 10-6is accepted.ExampleInput:3\r\n1 1 1\r\n10 10 10\r\n23 46 69Output:0.154701\r\n1.547005\r\n6.000000You can see my submission history and time record for this problem:hereSee also:Another problem added by Tjandra Satria Gunawan",
