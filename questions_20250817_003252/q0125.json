  "text": "You are given 'n' integers k1, k2... knand an integer 'x', which satisfy the equation x1k1* x2k2* ... * xnkn= x. You are also given values a1, a2... anand y1, y2... yn. Your task is to find the least positive value 'v', that can be taken by the expression: a1*x1y1+ a2*x2y2+ ... + an*xnyn. Note that x1, x2, x3... xnare some variables (not necessarily integers), which can only take positive values.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer 't', denoting the number of test cases.The first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers 'n' and 'x'.Next line contains 'n' integers k1, k2... kn.Next line contains 'n' integers a1, a2... an.Next line contains 'n' integers y1, y2... yn.OutputFor each testcase output the least positive value 'v' that can be taken by the expression. To avoid floating point errors, round it off to the nearest integer.For example, 12.6 is rounded off to 13, and 12.4 is rounded off to 12. To avoid ambiguity, there will be no test case for which the fractional part of the answer equals 0.5.ExampleInput:2\r\n1 4\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n2 6\r\n1 1\r\n1 1\r\n1 1Output:24\r\n5Constraintst <= 251 <= n <= 201 <= x <= 10000001 <= ki, ai, yi<= 20xi> 0ExplanationTest case 1: x12= 4. Therefore, x1= 2 and 3*x13= 24.Test case 2: x1*x2= 6. Minimum value of x1+ x2is 2*sqrt(6) = 4.89897. x1= sqrt(6) and x2= sqrt(6) gives this solution. Answer is 4.89897, which when rounded off to the nearest integer equals 5.",
