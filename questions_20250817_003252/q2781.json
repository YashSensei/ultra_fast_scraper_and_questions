  "text": "Nested quotations are great not only for writing literature\r\n    with a complex narrative structure, but also in programming\r\n    languages. While it may seem necessary to use different\r\n    quotation marks at different nesting levels for clarity, there\r\n    is an alternative. We can display various nesting levels using\r\n    $k$-quotations, which are\r\n    defined as follows.A $1$-quotation is a\r\n    string that begins with a quote character, ends with another\r\n    quote character and contains no quote characters in-between.\r\n    These are just the usual (unnested) quotations. For example,'this is a string'is a \r\n    $1$-quotation.For $k > 1$, a\r\n    $k$-quotation is a string\r\n    that begins with $k$ quote\r\n    characters, ends with another \r\n    $k$ quote characters and contains a\r\n    nested string in-between. The nested string is a non-empty\r\n    sequence of$(k-1)$-quotations, which may\r\n    be preceded, separated, and/or succeeded by any number of\r\n    non-quote characters. For example,''All\r\n    'work' and no 'play'''is a \r\n    $2$-quotation.Given a description of a string, you must determine its\r\n    maximum possible nesting level.InputMultiple test cases. Please process until EOF is reached. For each test case:The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an\r\n    integer $n$ (\r\n    $1 \\le n \\le 100$). The second line\r\n    contains $n$ integers\r\n    $a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_ n$\r\n    ($1 \\le a_ i \\le 100$),\r\n    which describe a string as follows. The string starts with\r\n    $a_1$ quote characters,\r\n    which are followed by a positive number of non-quote\r\n    characters, which are followed by \r\n    $a_2$ quote characters, which are\r\n    followed by a positive number of non-quote characters, and so\r\n    on, until the string ends with \r\n    $a_ n$ quote characters.OutputFor each test case, display the largest number \r\n    $k$ such that a string described by\r\n    the input is a \r\n    $k$-quotation. If there is no such\r\n    $k$, displayno quotationinstead.ExampleInput:5\r\n2 1 1 1 3\r\n1\r\n22\r\n1\r\n1Output:2\r\n4\r\nno quotation",
