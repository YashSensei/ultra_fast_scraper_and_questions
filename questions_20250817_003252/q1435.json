The pieces must be cutin order exactlya1, a2... anfrom left to right.At each step, you may cut a piece into two smaller pieces. The cost for that cut is the length of the piece before cutting.Different cut order will result in different costs.For example, you need to cut a wooden stick of length 20 into 4 pieces of length 3, 5, 2 and 10 in order.When cutting from left to right:20 cuts into 3 and 17, cost 20.17 cuts into 5 and 12, cost 17.12 cuts into 2 and 10, cost 12.Total cost: 49When cutting from right to left:20 cuts into 10 and 10, cost 20.10 cuts into 8 and 2, cost 10.8 cuts into 3 and 5, cost 8.Total cost: 38Find the minimum cost to cut the initial piece into n given smaller pieces.InputLine 1: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000)Line 2: n positive integers a1, a2 ... an, knowing that the length of the wooden bar a1 + a 2 + ... + an ≤ 500000OutputA single integer which is the smallest cost found.ExampleInput:4\n3 5 2 10Output:37",
