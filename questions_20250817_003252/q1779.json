  "text": "You probably know those quizzes in Sunday magazines: given the sequence 1, 2,\r\n3, 4, 5, what is the next number? Sometimes it is very easy to answer,\r\nsometimes it could be pretty hard. Because these \"sequence problems\" are very\r\npopular, ACM wants to implement them into the \"Free Time\" section of their\r\nnew WAP portal.ACM programmers have noticed that some of the quizzes can be solved by\r\ndescribing the sequence by polynomials. For example, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\r\ncan be easily understood as a trivial polynomial. The next number is 6. But even\r\nmore complex sequences, like 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, can be described by a polynomial.\r\nIn this case, \r\n1/2.n2-1/2.n+1 can be used. Note that even\r\nif the members of the sequence are integers, polynomial coefficients may be any\r\nreal numbers.Polynomial is an expression in the following form:P(n) =aD.nD+aD-1.nD-1+...+a1.n+a0IfaD<> 0, the numberDis called adegreeof the polynomial. Note\r\nthat constant functionP(n) =Ccan be considered as polynomial of degree 0, and\r\nthe zero functionP(n) = 0 is usually defined to have degree -1.InputThere is a single positive integerTon the first line of input (equal to about 5000). It stands\r\nfor the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two\r\nlines. First line of each test case contains two integer numbersSandCseparated by a single space, \r\n1 ≤S< 100, \r\n1 ≤C< 100,\r\n\r\n(S+C) ≤ 100. The first number,S, stands for the length of the given\r\nsequence, the second number,Cis the amount of numbers you are to find to\r\ncomplete the sequence.The second line of each test case containsSinteger numbersX1,X2...XSseparated by a space. These numbers form the given\r\nsequence. The sequence can always be described by a polynomialP(n) \r\nsuch that for everyi,Xi=P(i). Among these polynomials, we can find the\r\npolynomialPminwith the lowest possible degree. This polynomial should be\r\nused for completing the sequence.OutputFor every test case, your program must print a single line containingCinteger numbers, separated by a space. These numbers are the values\r\ncompleting the sequence according to the polynomial of the lowest possible\r\ndegree. In other words, you are to print valuesPmin(S+1),Pmin(S+2) ...Pmin(S+C).It is guaranteed that the resultsPmin(S+i) will be non-negative and\r\nwill fit into the standardintegertype.ExampleInput:4\r\n6 3\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n8 2\r\n1 2 4 7 11 16 22 29\r\n10 2\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\r\n1 10\r\n3Output:7 8 9\r\n37 46\r\n11 56\r\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
