  "text": "Habluis a hardworking programmer. He solves lots of easy problems everyday :P.Hablu's teammateBabluis busy with studies, so amount of solved by him is smaller thanHablu's.Their coachNannaMianoticed the fact that the number of solved problems byHabluis a multiple of number of solved problems byBablu.ThenNannaMiaaskedHablua question. Giving a collection of integers S,NannaMiasaid that the number of solved problems byBabluis not a multiple of any integer contained in S (S only contains primes or 1). How many valid integers are there which could be the number of problems solved byBablu.AsHablusolves only easy problems, he is unable to solve this one. So, you need to help him :)InputThe first line contains t, number of test cases (t â‰¤ 1500).Each case starts with an integer H, the number of problems solved byHabluand K, the size of the collection S. The next line contains K space separated integers (the members of S).Remember that the online judge in which they solve has only(!) 1012problems. So no number will be greater than 1012. And K will be between 0 and 500.OutputPrint a line for each test case containing the number of possible integers which can be the number of solved problems byBablu.ExampleInput:1\r\n58 2\r\n2 3Output:2Note: It may be impossible to pass the time limit in some languages.",
