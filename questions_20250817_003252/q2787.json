  "text": "You have w white, r red, g green and b blue balloons. To make a single student happy you need exactly four balloons. All four balloons given to a student shouldn't have the same color. What is the maximum number S of happy students if we know number of balloons of each color?Your task is to write a program that for given values w, r, g and b will find the  S.InputInput starts with an integer T (≤ 20000), denoting the number of test cases.Each test case contains four integers w, r, g and b (0 ≤ w, r, g, b ≤ 109) — the number of white, red, green and blue balloons respectively. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.OutputFor each test case print a single integer S — maximum number of happy students.ExampleInput:2\r\n2 2 1 3\r\n1 1 4 1Output:Case 1: 2\r\nCase 2: 1",
