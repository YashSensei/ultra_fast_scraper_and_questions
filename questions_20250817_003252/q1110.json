  "text": "Jiajia is the king of the GbAaY Kingdom. He always squeezes his 20 ministers as coolies.\r\n    There arencities andmtwo-way roads connecting cities in the kingdom.\r\n    Because of the increasing cost of fuel, he wants to simplify the road system\r\n    in the GbAaY Kingdom.\r\n    Thus, some roads will be removed. But he requests the ministers to guarantee\r\n    that there is always a path between any two cities.\r\n    GbAaY Minister Loner suggests Jiajia for the convenience of the traffic management,\r\n    the farthest distance between cities should be minimal. Unhesitatingly, Jiajia agrees this resolution.\r\n    As the GbAaY Kingdom's minister (cooly), you must work hard for Jiajia to make the simplification plan.InputThe first line contains two integersn,m(1 ≤n≤ 200,n- 1 ≤m≤ 20000).\r\n    Each line of the followingmlines contains three integersu,v,w(u≠v, 0 ≤w≤ 105).\r\n    They denote there is a road with lengthwbetween cityuand cityv.OutputThe first line contains one integer which is the farthest distance between cities after the simplification.\r\n    Each line of the follown- 1 contains two integersu,v(u<v).\r\n    They denote there is a road between cityuand cityvin the simplification plan.\r\n    If there are many optimal solutions, any of them will be accepted.ExampleInput:3 3\r\n1 2 1\r\n2 3 1\r\n1 3 1Output:2\r\n1 2\r\n1 3",
