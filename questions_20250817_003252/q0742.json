Each node has an integer weight.We will ask you to perform the following operation:u v k: ask for the kth minimum weight on the path from nodeuto nodevInputIn the first line there are two integersNandM. (N, Mâ‰¤ 100000)In the second line there areNintegers. The ith integer denotes the weight of the ith node.In the nextN-1lines, each line contains two integersuv, which describes an edge (u,v).In the nextMlines, each line contains three integersuvk, which means an operation asking for the kth minimum weight on the path from nodeuto nodev.OutputFor each operation, print its result.ExampleInput:8 5\r\n105 2 9 3 8 5 7 7\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n3 5\r\n3 6\r\n3 7\r\n4 82 5 12 5 22 5 32 5 47 8 2Output:2891057",
