  "text": "A Square free number is a number whose sum of every adjacent two digits is not a perfect square and doesn't contain digit 0. For example, 123 is a square free number cause sum of first two adjacent digits 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect square and sum of last two adjacent digits 2 + 3 = 5 is not a perfect square.You are given an integer n. You have to calculate the number of n-digit square free number.As the result can be very big, output the result modulo 1000000007 (1e9 + 7).InputFirst line of the input contains a number T, the number of test cases.Each of the next T lines will contain an integer n.OutputOutput the number of square free numbers of length n.ConstraintsT <= 1000.1 <= n <= 1018.ExampleInput:3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3Output:6\r\n67\r\n501Note: By definition 1, 4, 9 is not square free number.",
