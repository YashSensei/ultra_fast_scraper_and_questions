  "text": "Mahmud solved some easy math problems from SPOJ and called himself king of number theory.GodFatherGodMATHer Rashad heard it and got angry, so he kidnapped Mahmud. Rashad gave him a task called \"Operation - Modulo\". Mahmud must solve this task, you know what will happen otherwise ;(. In the Operation - Modulo, we define a functionf(n) = (n mod 1) + (n mod 2) + (n mod 3) + ... + (n mod n), where n mod x denotes the remainder when dividingnbyx. Rashad interests with integers n such thatf(n) = f(n - 1), so he gave Mahmud two numbersLandR, and demands him to find the sum of all integersnsuch thatL ≤ n ≤ Randf(n) = f(n - 1).InputFirst and the only line of input contains two positive integers,LandR(1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1018).OutputPrint the demanded sum in one line.ExampleInput:1 3Output:3Note:I hope you proved your solution before submitting it :)",
