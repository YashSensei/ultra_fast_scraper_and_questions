  "text": "Define F(n, k) = Sum of kthpowers of all divisors of n, so for example F(6, 2) = 12+ 22+ 32+ 62= 50Define further G(a, b, k) as: Sum of F(j, k) where j varies from a to b both inclusive.Your task is to find G(a, b, k) given a, b and k.As values of G can get very large, you only need to output the value of G(a, b, k) modulo 109+7.InputFirst line of input file contains a single integer T - denoting the number of test cases.The follow description of T test cases. Each test case occupies exactly one line which contains three space separated integers a, b and k.OutputOutput your result for each test case in a new line.SampleInput:2\r\n2 2 1\r\n1 3 2Output:3\r\n16Description of SampleIn case 1, we are to find sum of divisors of 2. which is nothing but 1 + 2 = 3.In case 2, we are to find sum of squares of divisors of 1, 2 and 3. So for 12sum is = 1. For 2 sum is = 12+ 22= 5. For 3 sum is = 12+ 32= 10.\r\nSo answer is 16.Constraints1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1051 ≤ k ≤ 105Number of test cases ≤ 20",
