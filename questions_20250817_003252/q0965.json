  "text": "In mathematics, the N-th root of a number M, is a number K such that KN= M , i.e. KKK ... K = M where K is multiplied N times.We can translate this into strings. In string notation, the juxtaposition is concatenation instead of multiplication. So, the N-th root of a string S is another string T such that TN= S, where T N = TTT ... T is the string T concatenated N times. For instance, if S = “abcabcabcabc”, for N = 2 the string T = “abcabc” is the N-th root of S, while for N = 4 its N-th root is T = “abc”. Note that for N = 1 any string S is the N-th root of S itself.Given a string S you have to find the maximum N such that the N-th root of S exists. In the above example the answer would be 4, because there is no N-th root of S = “abcabcabcabc” for N > 4.InputThe input contains several test cases, each one described in a single line. The line contains a non-empty string S of at most 105characters, entirely formed of digits and lowercase letters. The last line of the input contains a single asterisk (“*”) and should not be processed as a test case.OutputFor each test case output a single line with the greatest integer N such that there exists a string T that concatenated N times is equal to S.ExampleInput:abcabcabcabc\r\nabcdefgh012\r\naaaaaaaaaa\r\n*Output:4\r\n1\r\n10",
