  "text": "You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with N nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to N. We define dist(a, b) as the number of edges on the path from node a to node b.Each node has a color, white or black. All the nodes are black initially.We will ask you to perform some instructions of the following form:0 i : change the color of i-th node(from black to white, or from white to black).1v: ask for the minimum dist(u,v), node u must be white(u can be equal tov). Obviously, as long as nodevis white, the result will always be 0.InputIn the first line there is an integer N (N ≤ 100000)In the next N-1 lines, the i-th line describes the i-th edge: a line with two integers a b denotes an edge between a and b.In the next line, there is an integer Q denotes the number of instructions (Q ≤ 100000)In the next Q lines, each line contains an instruction \"0 i\" or \"1v\"OutputFor each \"1v\" operation, print one integer representing its result.\r\nIf there is no white node in the tree, you should write \"-1\".ExampleInput:10\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n1 5\r\n1 6\r\n4 7\r\n7 8\r\n5 9\r\n1 10\r\n10\r\n0 6\r\n0 6\r\n0 6\r\n1 3\r\n0 1\r\n0 1\r\n1 3\r\n1 10\r\n1 4\r\n1 6Output:2\r\n2\r\n2\r\n3\r\n0",
