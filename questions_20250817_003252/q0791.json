  "text": "Sathish and Kathiresan are known for Coin Fight. Kathiresan kept on tossing a biased coin repeatedly. Then he decided to solve the following problem.Find the number of tosses for which the probability of getting exactly K heads is maximum. In case of a tie, return the minimum number of tosses.In other words, find the minimum n such that probability (exactly K heads with n tosses) ≥ probability (exactly K heads with m tosses) for any m ≠ n.InputThe first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case you are given an integer K, the number of heads required and a float p, the probability to get a head when the coin is tossed.OutputFor each test case find the number of tosses required as defined.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 1001 ≤ K ≤ 1000.00 < p ≤ 1.00p will always contain a maximum of 2 decimal places.SampleInput:3\r\n5 1.00\r\n1 0.50\r\n2 0.30Output:5\r\n1\r\n6",
