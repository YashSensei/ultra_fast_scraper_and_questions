For each k-query (i, j, k), you have to return the number of elementsgreater thank in the subsequence ai, ai+1... aj.InputLine 1: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30000).Line 2: n numbers a1, a2... an(1 ≤ ai≤ 109).Line 3: q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200000), the number of k- queries.In the next q lines, each line contains 3 numbers a, b, c representing a k-query. You should do the following:i = a xor last_ansj = b xor last_ansk = c xor last_ansAfter that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109holds.Where last_ans = the answer to the last query (for the first query it's 0).OutputFor each k-query (i, j, k), print the number of elements greater than k in the subsequence ai, ai+1... ajin a single line.ExampleInput:6\r\n8 9 3 5 1 9\r\n5\r\n2 3 5\r\n3 3 7\r\n0 0 11\r\n0 0 2\r\n3 7 4Output:1\r\n1\r\n0\r\n0\r\n2[Edited by EB]There are invalid queries. Assume the following:if i < 1: i = 1if j > n: j = nif i > j: ans = 0",
