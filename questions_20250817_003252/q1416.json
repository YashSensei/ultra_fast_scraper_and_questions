  "text": "Triangulation of surfaces has applications in the Finite Element Method of\r\nsolid mechanics. The objective is to estimate the stress and strain on complex\r\nobjects by partitioning theminto small simple objects which are considered\r\nincompressible. It is convenient to approximate a plane surface with a simple\r\npolygon, i.e., a piecewise-linear, closed curve in the plane on m distinct\r\nvertices, which does not intersect itself. A chord is a line segment between two\r\nnon-adjacent vertices of the polygon which lies entirely inside the polygon,\r\nso in particular, the endpoints of the chord are the only points of the chord\r\nthat touch the  boundary of the polygon.A triangulation of the polygon, is any choice of m −3 chords, such\r\nthat the polygon is divided into triangles. In a triangulation,\r\no two of the chosen chords intersect each other, except at endpoints,\r\nand all of the remaining (unchosen) chords cross at least one of the\r\nchosen chords. Fortunately, ﬁnding an arbitrary triangulation is a\r\nfairly easy task, but what if you were asked to ﬁnd the best triangulation\r\naccording to some measure?InputOn the first line of the input is a single positive integer n, telling\r\nthe number of test scenarios to follow. Each scenario begins with a line\r\ncontaining one positive integer 2 < m < 50, being the number of vertices\r\nof the simple polygon. The following m lines contain the vertices of the\r\npolygon in the order they appear along the border, going either clockwise\r\nor counter clockwise, starting at an arbitrary vertex.Each vertex is described by a pair of integers x y obeying 0 <= x <=\r\n10000 and 0 <= y <= 10000.OutputFor each scenario, output one line containing the area of the largest triangle  in the triangulation of the polygon which has the smallest largest triangle. The area should be presented with one fractional decimal digit.Sample Input1\r\n6\r\n7 0\r\n6 2\r\n9 5\r\n3 5\r\n0 3\r\n1 1Sample Output9.0",
