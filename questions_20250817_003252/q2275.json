  "text": "GIven two sequences of integers, your task is to find the longest common subsequence where every two adjacent values differ the same.For example, if the sequences are A = {1, 5, 8, 3} and B = {3, 10, 5}, then the common subsequence with adjacent values same are AL= {1, 8, 3} and BL= {3, 10, 5} since the differences in ALare 7 and -5 which is also the same in BL.InputFirst line of the input contains NAand NB, the sizes of the sequences A and B. Then follow two lines, the sequences A and B. (1 ≤ NA, NB≤ 1000 and all values in the sequence will lie between -1e9 and 1e9).OutputPrint one line, the length of the LCDS as described above.ExamplesInput:4 3\r\n1 5 8 3\r\n3 10 5Output:3Input:1 2\r\n5\r\n6 8Output:1",
