  "text": "Rashid loves mathematics. He recently started to learn how the various function works in mathematics. On his journey through the math world, he came in touch with a function named Y.He also came to know that, here Y means the summation of number from 0 to n. For example if n = 5, thenY = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15Now he is wondering if the knows the value of Y, can he find the value of n for the above equation?Being so very new to the math world, he could not figure out how to approach this new problem. So he came to you for help. Can you help him?InputFirst line of input will beT (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000), denoting the number of test cases.NextTlines will contain the numberY (1 ≤ Y ≤ 3×109), value of the above function.OutputFor each test case, if there is exist a value ofnfor which the above function gives the outputYthen print\r\nthat value ofn, otherwise print “NAI” (quotes for clarification).Note: Data set is huge, use scanf, printf for faster input, output.SampleInput5\r\n11\r\n15\r\n21\r\n1\r\n7626OutputNAI\r\n5\r\n6\r\n1\r\n123",
