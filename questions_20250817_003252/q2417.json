Every point in the grid has up to eight neighboring points (see figure 1).Figure 1: Neighboring points (marked by arrows).We are interested in counting the number of different ways to connect the points of the grid to form     a polygon that fulfils the following conditions:The set of vertices of the polygon consists of all 3 × N points.Adjacent vertices of the polygon are neighboring points in the grid.Each polygon is simple, i.e. there must not be any self-intersections.Two possible polygons for N = 6 are given in the figure 2.Figure 2: Two possible connections of points for N = 6.Write a program that calculates for a given N the number of possible ways to connect the points as     described modulo 1,000,000,000.InputThe first and only line contains one positive integer N (N ≤ 1,000,000,000).OutputThe only line to be written contains the remainder of the number of ways to connect the points modulo 1,000,000,000.ExampleInput:3Output:8Input:4Output:40",
