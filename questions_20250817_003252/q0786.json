  "text": "You are givennnumbers initially. You have to maintain amultisetfor thosennumbers. Then you are givenqqueries. Queries will be one of the following types:1 x: Letabe the count of elements smaller than or equal tox. Addx+ainto the multiset.2 y: report the number of numbers in the multiset that are smaller than or equal toy.3 z: report thezth smallest number of the multiset. Note that if any numberdappears more than once, it is to be counted as many times it appears! Also, if z exceeds the number of elements in themultiset, that is answer for this query doesn't exist, print \"invalid\". Look at the sample input for clarification.NoteSince it is amultiset, it will also store duplicates. Also, lets say our multiset has elements 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3. then for z=3, answer would be2.Constraints1 ≤ n ≤ 1000001 ≤ q ≤ 1000001 ≤ x ≤ (109- 2 × 105)1 ≤ y, z ≤ 1091 ≤ Initial elements of the multiset ≤ (109- 2 × 105)InputThe first line will contain two integers, n and q, denoting the number of initial members of the multiset and the number of queries.Next q lines will be of he form:Type D :That is, the queries will be of the one of given 3 types and accordingly, you will be given an integer D.OutputYou have to print the output for query numbers2and3.ExampleInput:10 20\r\n7 35 44 25 15 10 21 42 12 33\r\n1 6\r\n1 39\r\n2 47\r\n2 96\r\n1 29\r\n2 40\r\n3 27\r\n3 5\r\n1 22\r\n1 44\r\n3 32\r\n1 28\r\n3 2\r\n2 39\r\n3 23\r\n2 31\r\n1 13\r\n1 50\r\n3 38\r\n2 26Output:11\r\n12\r\n10\r\ninvalid\r\n15\r\ninvalid\r\n7\r\n12\r\ninvalid\r\n8\r\ninvalid\r\n8",
