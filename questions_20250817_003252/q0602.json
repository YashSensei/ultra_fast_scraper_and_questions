  "text": "A beehive is an enclosed structure in which some honey bee species live and raise their\r\nyoung. In this problem we consider a two-dimensional sketch of the beehives. Each\r\nbeehive is composed of a certain number of cells, where each cell is a regular hexagon.\r\nEach cell may have some neighbors, which are other cells that share a side with that cell.\r\nA cell with exactly 6 neighbors is an internal cell, while a cell with fewer neighbors is an\r\nexternal one. Notice that an external cell can always be changed to internal by adding\r\nsome neighbor cells.We are interested in a particular class of beehives. This class of valid beehives is defined\r\nrecursively as follows: a) a single cell is a valid beehive; and b) given a valid beehive B,\r\nif we add the minimum number of cells such that each external cell of B becomes an\r\ninternal cell, the result is a valid beehive.The number of cells in a valid beehive is called a beehive number. Given an integer N,\r\nyou must decide whether it is a beehive number.InputEach test case is described using a single line. The line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 109).\r\nThe end of input is indicated with a line containing a single −1.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing an uppercase “Y” if N is a beehive number, or an uppercase “N” otherwise.ExampleInput:43\r\n1\r\n7\r\n19\r\n15\r\n-1Output:N\r\nY\r\nY\r\nY\r\nN",
