If you fail in it, you will have to come.Stir: ok...Ling gives Stir a number x and the challenge is to find the largest value of n such that n! is not greater than the largest value that can be formed by x digits. Stir is stuck with the problem and needs your help. Now, it's your turn to make sure that Stir can continue having fun with factorials.InputThe first line of the input contains a number t (about 105), the number of the test cases. The next t lines contain a number x (1 ≤ x ≤ 109).OutputOutput a total of t lines with each line containing the value n corresponding to the input case.ExampleInput:217Output:310",
