  "text": "You are given a series defined by the following recurrence:f0= x, f1= yfn= a * fn-1+ b * fn-2You are required to find the summation of the following series:f0k+f1k+f2k+ ... +fnkThe valuesa,b,x,y,n,kwill be provided. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo1000000007.InputThe first line contains a single integerTdenoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists ofsixspace separated integers on a single line, in the order:a,b,x,y,n,k.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer (on a separate line) denoting the summation of the series as mentioned above.Constraints1 ≤ T≤ 5000≤a, b≤1000≤x, y≤1090≤ n≤ 10150≤ k≤ 1000ExampleInput:4\r\n1 1 0 1 3 0\r\n1 1 0 1 3 1\r\n1 1 0 1 4 2\r\n1 1 0 1 4 3Output:4\r\n4\r\n15\r\n37ExplanationIn all the sample test cases,f0= 0, f1= 1, fn= fn-1+ fn-2, which is the regularFibonacciseries. The first few terms of the sequence are0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ....For the first case, the required sum is00+ 10+ 10+ 20= 4.For the second case, the required sum is01+ 11+ 11+ 21= 4.For the third case, the required sum is02+ 12+ 12+ 22+ 32= 15.For the fourth case, the required sum is03+ 13+ 13+ 23+ 33= 37.Note: Time limit is set leniently to allow slow languages to pass.",
