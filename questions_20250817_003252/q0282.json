M lines follow, each contains K non-negative integers aij(1 ≤ i ≤ M, 1 ≤ j ≤ K), which shows that there is one point (ai1, ai2, ... aik) in the K-D hyperspace. No two points will be the same, and none of them lies on any (coordinate) axis.OutputFor each test case:Output a single integer which shows the number of the points B (b1, b2, ... bk) in the hyperspace satisfies the following constraints:B is not on any (coordinate) axis.For each 1 ≤ i ≤ M, there exist j, 1 ≤ j ≤ k, such that bj< aij.For each 1 ≤ j ≤ k, bjis a non-negative integer.The sum of bjdoesn't exceed S.ExampleInput:1\r\n2 4 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 1Output:2HintThe two points are (1, 1) and (1, 2).",
