Can you help him to calculate his luck?InputFirst Line of the input file contains,T-number of test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Each test case followed by two integers,NandK. (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ K ≤ N) Next line containsN-space separated real values,Pi.OutputFor each test case, you have to print desired output (with up to10decimal places.)ExampleInput:1\r\n3 2\r\n0.0 0.5 1.0Output:0.5000000000",
