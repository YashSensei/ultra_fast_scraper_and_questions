  "text": "Using a sheet of paper and scissors, you can cut out two faces to\r\nform a cylinder in the following way:Cut the paper horizontally (parallel\r\nto the shorter side) to get two rectangular parts.From the first part, cut out a circle\r\nof maximum radius. The circle will form the bottom of the cylinder.Roll the second part up in such a way\r\nthat it has a perimeter of equal length with the circle's\r\ncircumference, and attach one end of the roll to the circle.\r\nNote that the roll may have some overlapping parts in order\r\nto get the required length of the perimeter.Given the dimensions of the sheet of paper, can you calculate the\r\nbiggest possible volume of a cylinder which can be constructed using the\r\nprocedure described above?Input SpecificationThe input consists of several test cases.\r\nEach test case consists of two numberswandh(1 ≤ w ≤ h ≤ 100), which indicate\r\nthe width and height of the sheet of paper.The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.Output SpecificationFor each test case, print one line with the biggest possible volume\r\nof the cylinder. Round this number to 3 places after the decimal point.Sample Input10 10\r\n10 50\r\n10 30\r\n0 0Sample Output54.247\r\n785.398\r\n412.095In the first case, the optimal cylinder has a radius of about\r\n1.591549,\r\nin the second case, the optimal cylinder has a radius of 5,\r\nand in the third case, the optimal cylinder has a radius of\r\nabout 3.621795.",
