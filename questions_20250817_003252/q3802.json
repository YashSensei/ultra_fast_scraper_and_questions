  "text": "Alice and Bob play an interesting game and the game is played on a number.So a player, on his chance, can choose any non zero digit of the number and decrease the digit by any non zero amount such that the resulting digit remains non-negative. The player who gets all the digits of the number 0 wins. Both play optimally and Alice starts first. Now tell how many numbers are there between A and B on which if the game is played Alice wins and also find how many numbers are there where Bob wins. On every number between A and B, Alice plays first on that number.InputThe input line consists of T test cases. On each line there are two numbers A and B.OutputThe output line consists of T lines each having two numbers.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 100001 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1018SampleInput:2\r\n1 10\r\n101 110Output:10 0\r\n8 2ExplanationIn the first case the first player Alice will always win because she can reduce any digit to 0.In the second case the second player Bob will win on 2 numbers 101 and 110. Rest Alice will win.",
