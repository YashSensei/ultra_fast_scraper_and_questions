  "text": "Ann Sister owns a genealogical database service, which maintains family tree history for her clients.\r\nWhen clients login to the system, they are presented with a variety of services: searching, printing,\r\nquerying, etc. One recent question that came up which the system was not quite prepared for was\r\nthe following: “Which member of my family had the most grandchildren?” The client who posed this\r\nquestion eventually had to answer it by manually searching the family tree database herself. Ann decided\r\nto have software written in case this question (or ones similar to it asking for great-grandchildren, or\r\ngreat-great-grandchildren, etc.) is asked in the future.InputInput will consist of multiple test cases. The first line of the input will contain a single integer indicating\r\nthe number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single line containing two positive integers n and\r\nd, where n indicates the number of lines to follow containing information about the family tree, and d\r\nindicates the specific question being asked about the tree: if d = 1, then we are interested in persons\r\nwith the most children (1 generation away); if d = 2, then we are interested in persons with the most\r\ngrandchildren (2 generations away), and so on. The next n lines are of the formname m dname1dname2... dnamemwherenameis one of the family members’ names,mis the number of his/her children, anddname1throughdnamemare the names of the children. These lines will be given in no particular order. You\r\nmay assume that all n lines describe one single, connected tree. There will be no more than 1000 people\r\nin any one tree, and all names will be at most 10 characters long.OutputFor each test case, output the three names with the largest number of specified descendants in order of\r\nnumber of descendants. If there are ties, output the names within the tie in alphabetical order. Print\r\nfewer than three names if there are fewer than three people who match the problem criteria (you should\r\nnot print anyone’s name who has 0 of the specified descendants), and print more than three if there is\r\na tie near the bottom of the list. Print each name one per line, followed by a single space and then the\r\nnumber of specified descendants. The output for each test case should start with the lineTreei:whereiis the test case number (starting at 1). Separate the output for each problem with a blank line.ExampleInput:3\r\n8 2\r\nBarney 2 Fred Ginger\r\nIngrid 1 Nolan\r\nCindy 1 Hal\r\nJeff 2 Oliva Peter\r\nDon 2 Ingrid Jeff\r\nFred 1 Kathy\r\nAndrea 4 Barney Cindy Don Eloise\r\nHal 2 Lionel Mary\r\n6 1\r\nPhillip 5 Jim Phil Jane Joe Paul\r\nJim 1 Jimmy\r\nPhil 1 Philly\r\nJane 1 Janey\r\nJoe 1 Joey\r\nPaul 1 Pauly\r\n6 2\r\nPhillip 5 Jim Phil Jane Joe Paul\r\nJim 1 Jimmy\r\nPhil 1 Philly\r\nJane 1 Janey\r\nJoe 1 Joey\r\nPaul 1 PaulyOutput:Tree 1:\r\nAndrea 5\r\nDon 3\r\nCindy 2\r\n\r\nTree 2:\r\nPhillip 5\r\nJane 1\r\nJim 1\r\nJoe 1\r\nPaul 1\r\nPhil 1\r\n\r\nTree 3:\r\nPhillip 5",
