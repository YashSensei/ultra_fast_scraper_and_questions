Find the minimum number of games the player should have played to achieve that average.The player can score any non-negative integer score in a game.InputThe first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a singlerational numberwhich represents the average score of the player.OutputFor each test case, find the minimum number of matches the player should have played to achieve that average.Constraints1  ≤  t  ≤  10001  ≤  average  ≤  1000000 (maximum 4 digits after the decimal place)ExampleInput:3\r\n5\r\n5.5\r\n30.25Output:1\r\n2\r\n4",
