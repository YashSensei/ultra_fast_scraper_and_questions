  "text": "Your younger brother's teacher gave him this simple problem.Givenbandc. Evaluate the result of this expression:Result1=bcYour brother definitely was able to solve this easy problem. So his teacher decided to give him a bit harder problem.Givena,bandc. Evaluate the result of this expression:Result1=bcResult2=aResult1However, your brother was also able to solve it. It was not that hard. His teacher was excited though and gave him this Bonus Programming Assignment.Write a program that is given a, b and c; calculates the value ofResult2. Since the output may be exponentially very large, checking the correctness of solutions will be a bit of a problem. So, instead of printing the whole value ofResult2, just print the remainder of dividingResult2by 1,000,000,007 (109+ 7).Can you help him solve that task?InputThe input consists of several test cases. Each case is on a single line. In each case, given three space separated integers a, b and c (0 <=a,b,c<= 231- 1). The input is terminated bya=b=c= -1OutputFor each case, print exactly one line containing the value ofResult2modulus 109+ 7ExampleInput:2 2 2\r\n3 4 5\r\n-1 -1 -1Output:16\r\n763327764NoteYou can assume that 00= 1.",
