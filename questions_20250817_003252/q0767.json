  "text": "In the War between good and evil . Ra-One is on the evil side and G-One on the good side.Ra-One is fond of destroying cities and its G-one's duty to protect them..Ra-One loves to destroy cities whose Zip Code has special properties. He says he loves to destroy cities which have Ra-One numbers as their Zip Code.Any number is Ra-one if the Difference between Sum of digits at even location and Sum of digits at odd location is One (1).. For eg... for 234563 is Ra-One numberdigits at odd location are 3,5,3 (unit place is location 1 )digits at even location are 2,4,6Diff = (2+4+6)-(3+5+3)=12-11 = 1.And 123456 is not Ra-One numberdiff = (5+3+1) - (2+4+6) = -4G-One knows this about Ra-one and wants to deploy his Army members in those cities. 1 army member will be deployed in each city.G-one knows the range of ZIP-Codes where Ra-One might attack & needs your help to find out how many army members he needs.Can you help Him ?InputFirst line will have only one integer 't' number of Zip-Code ranges. it is followed by t linesEach line from 2nd line contains 2 integer 'from'Â  and 'to'. These indicate the range of Zip codes where Ra-one might attack. ('From' and 'to' are included in the range)NOTE:'t' will be less than 100. 'from' and 'to' will be between 0 and 10^8 inclusive.OutputA single number for each test case telling how many army members G-One needs to deploy.each number should be on separate linesExampleInput:2\r\n1 10\r\n10 100Output:1\r\n9explanation:for 1st test case the only number is 10for 2nd test case numbers are 10, 21, 32, 43, 54, 65, 76, 87, 98",
