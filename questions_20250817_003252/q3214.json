See the original problem in Indonesian languagehere.------------------------GivenNsectors where 1<N<101000, from a circle that sown in the picture below:We will color each sector withKdifferent colors, where 2<K<101000such that each sector colored with one color and each adjacent sector must have different color. Your task is to count how many ways to color all that sectors.InputFirst line, there is a numberT(0<T<1000)Â denoting number of test cases, then T lines follow.each line containing two integers:NandKseparated by a space.OutputFor each test case, output number of ways to color the circle, since the number can be too large, take modulo 109+7.ExampleInput:2\r\n2 3\r\n3 3Output:6\r\n6Explanation:For the first case, we have two sectors and three colors, here is all possibilities:For second test case, we have three sector and three colors, here is all possibilities:Time limit set so that ~128 Bytes of python 3 code can get accepted, also my C top speed program AC in 0.12sHave fun :)See also:Another problem added by Tjandra Satria Gunawan",
