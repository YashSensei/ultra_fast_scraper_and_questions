  "text": "Mosa loves all sorts of properties of matrices. One day his coach Fegla asked him to draw a matrix with size N × M and insert random numbers in each cell, then he asked him to find the largest increasing sub-matrix.It's defined as a matrix that each cell in the position (i, j) is greater than the cells in positions:(i - 1, j), (i, j - 1) and (i - 1, j - 1).Help Mosa to find the size of the largest increasing sub-matrix.Inputt- the number of test cases, then t test cases follows. [t≤ 50]Each test case contains two integersNandMindicating the matrix dimensions [1 ≤N × M≤ 105].Each of the nextNlines containsMintegers, separated by a space, describing the elements of the matrix.ElementXi,jof the matrix is the jth integer of the ith line in the input [-109≤Xi,j≤ 109].OutputFor each test case in the input your program must print on single line, containing the solution of the problem.ExampleInput:2\r\n2 32 2 22 2 2\r\n3 31 2 54 6 710 8 3Output:16",
