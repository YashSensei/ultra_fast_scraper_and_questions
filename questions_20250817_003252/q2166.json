To do this in a funny way he intends to use an old Polish dictionary and play a game he learned from the old Carl.Given a word s in the dictionary, Russell is interested in sequences of suffixes of s. But not just any one! Russell considers amusing sequences of suffixes with the following properties:The suffixes appear in increasing sizes.The suffixes appear in lexicographic order.As an example, if s = ABACA then the sequences (ABACA), (A, CA) and (A, ACA, BACA) please Russell but (ABACA, ACA) or (CA, ACA) doesn't.Help Russell find the number of amusing sequences of suffixes of a given word s modulo 1000000007 (109+ 7).InputThe input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of only one line containing a stringSwith 1 to 100000 (105) uppercase Latin letters (A - Z).OutputFor each test case output a single line containing the number of amusing sequences of suffixes ofSmodulo 1000000007 (109+ 7).ExampleInput:ABACANIEPIJWODYCAMPINASOutput:1175820",
