  "text": "People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same problems every time.One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter.After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled.When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed.The wise man smiled and said:\"You can't laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem?\"He has also created a very simple game to cheer the people up. The game is as follows:You are given a sequence A of N integers.The task is to answer Q queries on the given sequence. For each query, you will be given four space-separated integers L, R, P, K.Print the index of Kthoccurrence of P in L to R(inclusive). If no such index exists, print -1.InputThe first line contains two space-separated integers N and Q.The second line contains N space-separated integers. (1-based indexing)Following Q lines contain,Four integers L, R, P, K.OutputFor each query, print a single line containing one integer between 1 to N i.e. index of the Kthoccurrence of P in L to R.Print -1 if no such index exists.Constraints2 ≤ N, Q ≤ 1051 ≤ Ai≤ 1061 ≤ L < R ≤ N1 ≤ P ≤ 1061 ≤ K ≤ NExampleInput:10 3\r\n1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4\r\n1 10 2 3\r\n1 5 2 3\r\n5 9 3 2Output:8\r\n-1\r\n9",
