  "text": "In number theory, Euler's totient (or PHI function), is an arithmetic function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to a positive integer N that are relatively prime to this number N.That is, if N is a positive integer, then PHI(N) is the number of integers K for which GCD(N, K) = 1 and 1 ≤ K ≤ N. We denote GCD the Greatest Common Divisor. For example, we have PHI(9)=6.Interestingly, PHI(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.InputThe input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.\r\nIn each of the next T lines there are an integer M.OutputFor each given M, you have to print on a single line the value of N, for which 1 < N < M, PHI(N) is a permutation of N and the ratio N/PHI(N) produces a minimum. If there's several answers output the greatest, or if need, \"No solution.\" without quotes.\r\nLeading zeros are not allowed for integers greater than 0.ExampleInput:3\r\n22\r\n222\r\n2222Output:21\r\n63\r\n291Explanations :For the first case, in the range ]1..22[, the lonely number n for which phi(n) is in permutations(n) is 21, (we have phi(21)=12). So the answer is obviously 21.\r\nFor the second case, in the range ]1..222[, there's two numbers n for which phi(n) is in permutations(n), we have phi(21)=12 and phi(63)=36. But as 63/36 is equal to 21/12, we're taking the greater : 63.\r\nFor the third case, in the range ]1..2222[, there's four numbers n for witch phi(n) is in permutations(n), phi(21)=12, phi(63)=36, phi(291)=192 and phi(502)=250. Within those solutions 291/192 is the minimum, we output 291.Constraints1 < T < 10^5\r\n1 < M < 10^7Code size limit is 10kB ; less than 500B of python3 code can get AC under 2s.\r\nAfter that you may tryTIP2.\r\n@Speed addicts : my C code ran in 0.02s, and my fastest python3.2 code ran in 1.21s, (0.90s in py2.7)Edit 2017-02-11, after compiler updates.
