  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is attending Assertive Club of Mathematicians. On last session, Ada had a fight with her friend Horntail Hansel. Hansel claimed, that if somebody picks a set of binary-vectors of lengthK, he can generate an infinitely long binary vector, which will have none of the smaller vectors as substring. Ada claimed opposite and now she is preparing a proof, she could pick a set (for anyK), that every such infinite vector will contain at least one of her vectors as substring. Obviously, it is true, since if she picks all2Kvectors, Hansel's vector will always have at least one of such vectors as substring (and even as prefix).She also wanted to construct such set, to add to importance, but then she realized2Kis too much, so instead she wanted to construct minimal such set. Can you help her to find the size of such set? Even though it might be lesser, it is still pretty big, so output it modulo109+7InputThe first line of input will contain1 ≤ T ≤ 106, the number of test-cases.The nextTlines will contain1 ≤ K ≤ 107, the size of binary vectors Ada wants to generate.OutputFor each test-case, output the minimum number of binary vectors of lengthKAda has to generate, so that Hansel can't make an infinite vector which wouldn't have at least one of Ada's vectors as substring. Output this modulo1000000007.Example Input7\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n13\r\n666\r\n123456\r\n3141592Example Output2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n632\r\n595842408\r\n994717838\r\n244191463Examples of first 3 inputs:0, 1\r\n00, 01, 11\r\n000, 001, 101, 111",
