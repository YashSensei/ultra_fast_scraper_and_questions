  "text": "These ten problems come from Chinese National Olympiad in Mathematics - Province Contest.Problem 1Polynomial P(x)=x5+a1x4+a2x3+a3x2+a4x+a5, and we know when k=1, 2, 3, 4, P(k)=2007*k. Calculate P(10)-P(-5).Problem 2The sum of 100 positive integers a1, a2, ..., a100is 2007. Calculate the maximum possible value of.Problem 3Calculate 100101102103104......498499500 modulo 126.Problem 4We define the sum of the first n numbers of geometric progression {an} Sn. Now we know S7=7, S14=2014. Calculate S7*(S21-S14).Problem 5Calculate the sum of this kind of positive integers n(n>=4): n satisfies that n! can be written as the product of n-3 consecutive positive integers.Problem 6Two vertices of a square are on the line y=2x-17, while the other two are on the parabola y=x2. Calculate the sum of two different possible values of the area of this square.Problem 7A, B, C, D are four fixed points in the space and they are not on the same plane. Calculate the number of different parallelepipeds, which satisfies that 4 vertices of the parallelepiped are A, B, C and D.Problem 8Polynomial x2-x-1 exactly divides Polynomial a1x17+a2x16+1. Calculate a1*a2.Problem 9Suppose x is an acute angle, calculate the minimum possible value of (sinx +cosx)/(sinx +tanx) + (tanx +cotx)/(cosx +tanx) + (sinx +cosx)/(cosx +cotx) + (tanx +cotx)/(sinx +cotx).Problem 10Suppose x4+y4+z4=m/n, x, y, z  are all real numbers, satisfying x*y+y*z+z*x=1 and 5*(x+1/x)=12*(y+1/y)=13*(z+1/z); m, n are positive integers and their greatest common divisor is 1. Calculate m+n.InputThere is no input.OutputTen lines, each contains a single integer denoted the answer to the correspoding problem.ExampleThere is no example.",
