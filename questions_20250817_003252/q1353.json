  "text": "A string is called a \"prime string\" if it can't be written as concatenation of more than one same strings. For example, the following strings are not prime strings: AAA, ABABAB, CFGFGCFGFG, while CFGFGC, ABABA are prime strings.Calculate the number of prime string of length N (1<=N<=1000000), and only contains first K (1<=K<=26) letters from English alphabet. Note that some of these K letters need not appear in that string.InputMultiple test cases. The number of them (about 10000) is given in the very first line.Each test case contains one line with two integers - K and N, separated by a single space.OutputFor each test case, output the required number modulo 1000000007 in a single line.ExampleInput:12 3Output:6ExplanationThe prime strings of length 3 which only contain character 'A' and 'B' are: AAB, ABA, ABB, BAA, BAB, BBA.Constraints1 <= N <= 10000001 <= K <= 26Total number of test cases is around 10000.",
