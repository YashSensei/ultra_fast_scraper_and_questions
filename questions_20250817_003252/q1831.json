  "text": "Let A = [a1, a2... an] be a permutation of\r\nintegers 1, 2 ... n. A pair of indices (i, j), 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, is aninversionof the permutation A if ai> aj. We are given integers n > 0\r\nand k ≥ 0. What is the number of n-element permutations containing exactly k\r\ninversions?For instance, the number of 4-element permutations with exactly 1 inversion\r\nequals 3.TaskWrite a program which for each data set from a sequence of several data sets:reads integers n and k from input,computes the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions,writes the result to output.InputThe first line of the input file contains one integer d, 1 ≤ d ≤ 10, which is the\r\nnumber of data sets. The data sets follow. Each data set occupies one line of\r\nthe input file and contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 12) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ 98)\r\nseparated by a single space.OutputThe i-th line of the output file should contain one integer - the number of\r\nn-element permutations with exactly k inversions.ExampleInput:1\r\n4 1Output:3",
