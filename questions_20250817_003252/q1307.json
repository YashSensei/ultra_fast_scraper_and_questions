Your task is to find X and Y such that product of their lengths is maximal possible.InputFirst line will contain one integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 106).Second line will contain N integers representing a sequence from the text of the task (0 ≤ Ai≤ 2×109).OutputFirst and only line of output should contain only one integer, the maximum possible product from the text of problem.ExampleInput:2\r\n1 1Output:1Input:4\r\n1 1 2 2Output:4Input:6\r\n10 11 12 12 11 10Output:4Input:6\r\n0 1 0 1 0 1Output:9",
