  "text": "Mr. B has recently discovered the grid named \"spiral grid\". Construct the grid like the following figure. (The grid is actually infinite. The figure is only a small part of it.)Considering traveling around it, you are free to any cell containing a composite number or 1, but traveling to any cell containing a prime number is disallowed. You can travel up, down, left or right, but not diagonally. Write a program to find the length of the shortest path between pairs of nonprime numbers, or report it's impossible.InputEach test case is described by a line of input containing two nonprime integer 1 <=x,y<=10,000.OutputFor each test case display its case number followed by the length of the shortest path orimpossiblein one line.ExampleInput:1 4\r\n9 32\r\n10 12Output:Case 1: 1\r\nCase 2: 7\r\nCase 3: impossible",
