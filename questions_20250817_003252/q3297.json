  "text": "This is a problem of Euclidean Geometry. See the figure below.Your task is as follows: given the lengths of segments b, c, and d, calculate the length of segment a.InputThe input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t ≤ 300). In each of\r\nthe next t lines there are three integers b, c and d  (0 ≤ b, c and d ≤ 10200; b, d < c)\r\nseparated by a space.OutputFor every test case print the length of the segment a, one number per line.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 8 5\r\n10 18 12Output:8\r\n14",
