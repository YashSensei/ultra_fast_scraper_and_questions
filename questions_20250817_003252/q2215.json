  "text": "For a given sequence a[1], a[2] ... a[n], lets call a subsequence a[k1] ... a[ki] ... a[km] (where 1 <= ki<= n and kii+1) as\"one X increasing subsequence\" if there is exactly one i between 1 and m-1 (inclusive) for which a[ki]>a[ki+1]. Given a sequence find the length of the longest \"one X increasing subsequence\".InputFirst line contains t, which denotes the number of test cases. 2×T lines follow. Each test case is described using 2 lines.First line of a test case contains an integer- n, which denotes the number of elements in the array.Second lines contains n integers, which represent a[i] 1 ≤ i ≤ n.1 ≤ t ≤ 201 ≤ n ≤ 1000001 ≤ a[i] ≤ 109OutputFor each test case, print one integer which represents the number of integers in the One X LIS. The output for each test case should be printed on a new line.ExampleInput:254 3 3 4 155 4 3 2 1Output:42ExplanationIn the first test case, the Longest Increasing Subsequence is 3.3.4 whereas the longest One X Subsequence is 4.3.3.4 whose length is 4.In the second example, any two elements can be chosen to form the longest One X Subsequence, which gives us an answer of 2.",
