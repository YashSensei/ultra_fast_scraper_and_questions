  "text": "Most of the programmers like the problem description to be as short as possible, right? I also never like the problem description to be so narrative.In this problem, you will be given an arrayaof n integers. If we multiply all the numbers of the array then we will get a result. Suppose the result isK.Let's introduce another list of all the common multiples of an array ascmp. Definitely, the list has an infinite number of elements.Suppose, we have an arraya= {2, 3, 6}. The result of multiplication of 2, 3 and 6 is 36. SoK= 36.The 1st common multiple ofais 6, the 2nd common multiple is 12, 3rd is 18, and so on.So the list,cmp = {6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, ....... }.Now the question is what the position ofK in the cmp list? (1-based indexing)As the result can be very big, you have to printK%1000000009(109+ 9), where % is modulo operator.Note: In the above-described example, the position ofKis 6. (cmp6= K = 36).InputThe first line of the input will ben, the number of elements in the array.In the next line,nelements of the arraya1,a2,a3...anwill be given.OutputPrint a single integer, the result of the problem described above with a new line.Constraints0 < n ≤ 1050 <ai≤ 109(1 ≤i≤ n)ExampleInput:3\r\n6 10 8Output:4",
