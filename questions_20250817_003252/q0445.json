He loves to append his name just after the precious word, “Competitive”. He is not much intelligent, nor much logical. But he loves to learn new algorithms and he loves to practice.The world he is currently living hasNalgorithms. You will be given anarray of efficiencyof sizeN, where if the ithelement is x, that means the initial efficiency of XOXO on that algorithm isx.XOXO will doMtasks in this month in order. The tasks will be of two types.1 K XThat means, the efficiency of XOXO on thekthalgorithm will be changed toX. It’s not guaranteed that the new value ofkthindex will be greater than the initial value. The efficiency might also decrease. XOXO is a human being after all.2 A BThere will be a contest arranged on which the efficiency of XOXO will be tested on the algorithms in the range betweenAandBinclusive. In that case, you have to tell the performance of XOXO on that contest which will be the sum of efficiencies inside that range.InputThe first input line has two integersNandM: the number of values and tasks. The second line hasNintegers e1, e2 ... eN: the values of the array of efficiency. Finally, there areMlines describing the tasks list. Each line has three integers: either \"1 K X\" or \"2 A B\"OutputPrint the result of each query of type 2.Constraints1 ≤ N, M ≤ 2×1051 ≤ ei, X ≤ 1091 ≤ k ≤ N1 ≤ A, B ≤ NSamplesInput:5 5\r\n2 3 6 4 8\r\n2 1 4\r\n2 5 5\r\n1 3 1\r\n2 1 4\r\n2 2 4Output:15\r\n8\r\n10\r\n8",
