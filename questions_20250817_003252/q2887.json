  "text": "You have a bag filled with N balls. Each ball has a distinct number from 1 to N printed on it. All the numbers are distinct.\r\nYou withdraw two balls from the bag and take their sum.\r\nYou need to calculate the probability that the sum is not greater than the given number K (≤ N).\r\nThe answer should be displayed in the form of p/q (except when the answer is 0 or 1.)InputInput consists of various test cases.\r\nEach test case consist of two integer inputs, N and K.\r\n(0 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1000000000)\r\nThe program stops taking input when N and K equals -1.OutputOutput the result in the form of p/q (except when the answer is 0 or 1.)ExampleInput:3 2\r\n100 5\r\n10 6\r\n-1 -1Output:0\r\n2/2475\r\n2/15",
