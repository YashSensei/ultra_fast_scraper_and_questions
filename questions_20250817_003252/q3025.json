She already knowsNmagical words.The conversion of a stolen word to magical word requires the following operations:Remove a character from the end of the word, which incurs a cost ofAcoinsAdd a character to the end, which incurs a cost ofBcoins.Help Billi save the kingdom by minimizing the cost required to convertexactly Kstolen words to magical words.InputFirst line of every test file contains the number of test cases, T.For each test case, first line contains 5 integers: A, B, K, N, MThe next N lines contain a string each, denoting the set of magical words known to Billi.The next M lines contain a string each, denoting the set of words stolen from Kaddu.ConstraintsT ≤ 201 ≤ N ≤ 100001 ≤ M ≤ 100001 ≤ K ≤ M1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000Length of each string ≤ 100The strings consist of only lowercase characters.OutputFor each test case, print the minimum cost for the task in a single line.ExampleInput2\r\n2 3 1 1 1\r\nabc\r\nbca\r\n2 3 2 5 4\r\nharry\r\npotter\r\nabcde\r\nqqwweerr\r\nab\r\nabc\r\nabcd\r\nqqwwweer\r\nputterOutput15\r\n5",
