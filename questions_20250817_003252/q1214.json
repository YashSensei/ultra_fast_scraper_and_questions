  "text": "PIHEX2All people use decimal system every day. For all of us the value of Pi is 3.141592653589793238462643383279....But it is common to use the hexadecimal system in programming. The hexadecimal value of Pi is 3.243F6A8885A308D313198A2E037073....In this problem for given value a, you should compute the digit that appears in hexadecimal representation of Pi at the athposition after comma (for a=0 the answer is '3' - the only digit before comma, for a=1 the answer is '2' - the first digit after comma; see example to clarify).InputThe first line of input contains single integer t - the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 20).The second line of input contains t single-space separated integers a1, a2... at(0 ≤ ai≤ 1000000).OutputThe only line of output should contain t hexadecimal digits (use capital letters A-F), where ithdigit appears in Pi hexadecimal representation at aithposition.ExampleInput:16\r\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000Output:3243F6A8885C3652",
