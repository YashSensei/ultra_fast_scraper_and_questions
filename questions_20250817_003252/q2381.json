Let’s build a GCD matrix  (S) = (sij), where  sij = GCD(xi, xj) – the greatest common divisor  of xi and xj. Given the factor closed set S, find the value of the determinant:InputThe input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts  with an integer  n (0 <  n < 1000), that stands for the cardinality  of  S. The next line contains the numbers of S: x1, x2, …, xn. It is known  that each xi is an integer, 0 < xi < 2*10^9. The input data set is  correct and ends with an end of file.OutputFor each test case find and print the value Dn mod 1000000007.SampleInput :\n2 \n1 2 \n3 \n1 3 9 \n4 \n1 2 3 6 \n\nOuput: \n1 \n12 \n4",
