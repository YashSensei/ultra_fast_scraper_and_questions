  "text": "You probably know what a set of collinear points is: a set of points such that there exists a straight line that passes through all of them. A set of cocircular points is deﬁned in the same fashion, but instead of a straight line, we ask that there is a circle such that every point of the set lies over its perimeter.The International Collinear Points Centre (ICPC) has assigned you the following task: given a set of points, calculate the size of the larger subset of cocircular points.InputEach test case is given using several lines. The ﬁrst line contains an integer N representing the number of points in the set (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Each of the next N lines contains two integers X and Y representing the coordinates of a point of the set (−104≤ X, Y ≤ 104). Within each test case, no two points have the same location.The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.OutputFor each test case output a single line with a single integer representing the number of points in one of the largest subsets of the input that are cocircular.SampleInput7\r\n-10 0\r\n0 -10\r\n10 0\r\n0 10\r\n-20 10\r\n-10 20\r\n-2 4\r\n4\r\n-10000 10000\r\n10000 10000\r\n10000 -10000\r\n-10000 -9999\r\n3\r\n-1 0\r\n0 0\r\n1 0\r\n0Output5\r\n3\r\n2",
