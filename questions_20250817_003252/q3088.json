  "text": "Harry Potter has n mixtures in front of him, arranged in a row.\r\nEach mixture has one of 100 different colors (colors have numbers\r\nfrom 0 to 99).He wants to mix all these mixtures together. At each step, he is going\r\nto take two mixtures that stand next to each other and mix them together,\r\nand put the resulting mixture in their place.When mixing two mixtures of colors a and b, the resulting mixture\r\nwill have the color (a+b) mod 100.Also, there will be some smoke in the process. The amount of smoke generated\r\nwhen mixing two mixtures of colors a and b is a*b.Find out what is the minimum amount of smoke that Harry can get when\r\nmixing all the mixtures together.InputThere will be a number of test cases in the input.The first line of each test case will contain n, the number of mixtures,\r\n1 <= n <= 100.The second line will contain n integers between 0 and 99 - the\r\ninitial colors of the mixtures.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum amount of smoke.ExampleInput:2\r\n18 19\r\n3\r\n40 60 20Output:342\r\n2400In the second test case, there are two possibilities:first mix 40 and 60 (smoke: 2400), getting 0, then mix 0 and 20 (smoke: 0);\r\ntotal amount of smoke is 2400first mix 60 and 20 (smoke: 1200), getting 80, then mix 40 and 80\r\n(smoke: 3200); total amount of smoke is 4400The first scenario is a much better way to proceed.",
