  "text": "The ACM Student Chapter has just been given custody of a number of\r\nschool bulletin boards. Several members\r\nagreed to clear off the old posters. They found posters\r\nplastered many levels deep. They made a bet about\r\nhow much area was left clear, what was the greatest depth of posters on\r\ntop of each other, and\r\nhow much of the area was covered to this greatest depth. To\r\ndetermine each bet's winner, they\r\nmade very accurate measurements of all the poster positions as they\r\nremoved them. Because of the large number of posters, they now\r\nneed a program to do the calculations. That is your job.A\r\nsimple illustration is shown above: a bulletin board 45 units\r\nwide by 40 high, with three posters, one with corners at coordinates\r\n(10, 10) and (35, 20), another with corners at (20, 25) and (40, 35), and the last\r\nwith corners at (25, 5) and (30, 30). The total area not covered\r\nby any poster is 1300. The maximum number of posters on top of\r\neach other is 2. The total area covered by exactly 2 posters\r\nis 75.InputThe input will\r\nconsist of one to twenty data\r\nsets, followed by a line containing only 0. On each\r\nline the data will consist of blank separated nonnegative integers.The first line of a dataset contains integersn w h,\r\nwherenis the number of posters on the bulletin board,wandhare the width\r\nand height of the bulletin board. Constraints are 0 <n≤\r\n\r\n100; 0 <w≤ 50000; 0 <h≤ 40000.The dataset ends with n lines, each describing the location of\r\none poster. Each poster is rectangular and has horizontal\r\nand vertical sides. The x and y coordinates are measured from one\r\ncorner of the bulletin board. Each line contains four numbersxlylxhandyh, wherexlandyl, are the lowest values of the x and y coordinates in one corner of the poster andxhandyhare the highest values in the diagonally opposite corner. Each poster fits on the bulletin board, so 0\r\n\r\n≤xl<xh≤w, and 0\r\n≤yl<yh≤h.OutputThere is one line of output for\r\neach data set containing three integers, the total area of the bulletin board that is not covered by any poster,the maximum depth of posters on top of each other, andthe total area covered this maximum number of times.Caution: An approach examining every pair of integer coordinates might need to deal with 2 billion coordinate pairs.ExampleInput:3 45 40\r\n10 10 35 20\r\n20 25 40 35\r\n25 5 30 30\r\n1 20 30\r\n5 5 15 25\r\n2 2000 1000\r\n0 0 1000 1000\r\n1000 0 2000 1000\r\n3 10 10\r\n0 0 10 10\r\n0 0 10 10\r\n0 0 10 10\r\n0Output:1300 2 75\r\n400 1 200\r\n0 1 2000000\r\n0 3 100",
