For each query, you need to add1at the following valid indices: ... ... a - 2 * b, a - b, a, a + b, a + 2 * b ... ... The indices that lie in the range[1, N]are only considered valid. Print the final array after the last update.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Every test case starts with two integers N and Q. After that, Q lines follow. In each line there will be two integers describing that query.1 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ N, Q, a, b ≤ 100000OutputPrint the final array after the last query with the case number.ExampleInput:1\r\n5 1\r\n1 2Output:Case 1: 1 0 1 0 1",
