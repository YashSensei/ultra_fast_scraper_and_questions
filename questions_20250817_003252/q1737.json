  "text": "All you have to do is implement the following algorithm, which is a very popular compression technique.You are given an input string A. (For example ababc)Find all the rotations of A (In this case, they are ababc, babca, abcab, bcaba, cabab)Now sort them (After sorting, we have ababc, abcab, babca, bcaba, cabab)Then arrange them as follows:ababcabcabbabcabcabacababNow pick out the last column. It is ‘cbaab’. This is the result of this algorithm.Also observe that the 1st row has the original string. (Use 1 indexing)Now, for this problem, you are given the output and the row number that has the original string. For the above example, it is ‘cbaab’ and 1.Given these 2 parameters, you just need to decode it. (i.e. find the original string.)Input:Each test case has 2 lines.1st line – An integer R that represents the row that contains the original string.2nd line - A string that represents the output of the above algorithm. (Length of string <=2000) (All characters are lower case).The input is terminated with R=-1.Output:The original string.SampleInput1\r\ncbaab\r\n3\r\nmnoag\r\n-1Outputababc\r\nmango",
