We need at leastAivolunteers in thei-th day. Now there areM(1 ≤M≤ 10000) kind of volunteers. Thei-th type of volunteers will work fromSi-th day toTi-th day, we will pay them $Ci. Now your task is to minimize the money KTH pay for all the volunteers.InputTen test cases (given one after another, you have to process all!). For each test case:The first line contains two space-separated integersNandM. The second line contains N nonnegative integersAi.Mlines follow, each contains three integersSi,TiandCi. You may assume you can hire almost unlimited number of every type of volunteers.Tip: During your calculation,intin C/C++/Java orlongintin Pascal is enough.OutputFor each test case:Output one line with an integer - the minimum cost.ExampleInput:3 3\r\n2 3 4\r\n1 2 2\r\n2 3 5\r\n3 3 2\r\n[and 9 test cases more]Output:14\r\n[and 9 test cases more]",
