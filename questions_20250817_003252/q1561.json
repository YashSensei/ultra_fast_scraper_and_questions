  "text": "While going through her friend’s secret diary, one-day Poga came upon a function. The function f was defined asf(n, k) - f(n-1, k) = f(n-1, k-1),\r\n            f(n, 0) = 1\r\n            and f(n, k) = 0 when n < kSeeing how this is a recursive function, Poga got very scared. To find courage, she remembered 2 of her favorite numbers, N and K. Now she wants to find the value of f(N, K). Being a genius, it was very easy for her. Now she has challenged you to do the same too. As the answer can become very big, you should print the answer modulo M.InputInput starts with an integerT, denoting the number of test cases.Then each of the next T lines contains three integersN,K, andM.Constraints1 <= T <= 1001 <= N <= 1050 <= K <= 1051 <= M <= 1012OutputFor each test case, print the answer, value off(N,K)moduloM.ExampleInput:5\r\n7 4 100\r\n6 3 2\r\n6 3 7\r\n2 2 200\r\n57217 10661734081Output:35\r\n0\r\n6\r\n1\r\n0",
