  "text": "It is necessary to find a minimal integer value R which is equal to the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of N non-identical rectangular triangles with integer lengths of sides.Inputt - number of test cases [t ≤ 100], then t lines follow, each line contains one integer - N, equal \r\nto the required number of different rectangular triangles. [1 ≤ N ≤ 2000]OutputFor each test case your program should output a number R in a separate line (R fits in a 64-bit integer), equal to the minimal integer value of a hypotenuse for which exactly N different rectangular triangles can be constructed; then in separate lines follow exactly N numbers equal to the shorter \r\ncathetus (side adjacent to the right angle) of each of the rectangular triangles, in ascending order.ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n2Output:5\r\n3\r\n25\r\n7\r\n15",
