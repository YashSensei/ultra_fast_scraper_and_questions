  "text": "Alice and Bob play the following game. First, they collect N small stones and put them together in one pile.\r\nAfter that, they throw a coin one by one. Alice starts first. If a player throws heads then he takes exactly one\r\nstone from the pile. In case of tails he don't do anything. The one who takes the last stone wins.\r\nFor each player, his skill of throwing a coin is known (to everyone, including himself and his opponent).\r\nMore precisely, if Alice wants to throw some specific side of the coin, she always succeeds with probability P.\r\nThe same probability for Bob is Q.\r\n\r\nYou are to find probability that Alice will win the game if both guys play optimally.InputInput starts with a line containing one integer T - a number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 50).\r\nThen T test cases follow. Each of them is one line with three numbers N, P, and Q separated with a space\r\n(1 ≤ N ≤ 99999999, 0.5 ≤ P, Q ≤ 0.99999999). P and Q have not more than 8 digits after decimal point.OutputFor each test case output one line with a probability that Alice will win the game.\r\nYour answer must be precise up to 10-6.ExampleInput:1\r\n1 0.5 0.5Output:0.666666667",
