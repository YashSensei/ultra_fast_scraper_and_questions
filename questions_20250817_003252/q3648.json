  "text": "RKis a great code breaker. He knows any cipher in the world can be broken by frequency analysis. He intercepted an enemy message. The message consists ofNnumbers, smaller than or equal toC. RK believes frequency analysis consists of sorting this sequence so that more frequent numbers appear before less frequent ones.Formally, the sequence must be sorted so that given any two numbers X and Y, X appears before Y if the number of times X appears in the original sequence is larger than the number of time Y does. If the number of appearances is equal, the number whose value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence.Help RK by creating a \"frequency sorter\".InputFirst line of input contains two  integers, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), length of message, and C (1 ≤ C ≤ 109), the number from task description. Next line contains N integers smaller than or equal to C, message  itself.OutputFirst and only line of output should contain N numbers, the sorted sequence.SampleInput9 3\r\n1 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1Output1 1 1 3 3 3 2 2 2Input5 2\r\n2 1 2 1 2Output2 2 2 1 1",
