  "text": "A straightforward question. Given an array of positive integers you have to print the number of subarrays whose XOR is less thanK. Subarrays are defined as a sequence of continuous elementsAi, Ai+1... Aj. XOR of a subarray is defined asAi^ Ai+1^  ... ^ Aj. Symbol^is Exclusive Or. You can read more about it here:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or.InputFirst line containsT, the number of test cases. Each of the test case consists ofNandKin one line, followed byNspace separated integers in next line.OutputFor each test case, print the required answer.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ N ≤ 1051 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1051 ≤ K ≤ 106Sum of N over all testcases will not exceed 105.Sample Input:1\r\n5 2\r\n4 1 3 2 7Sample Output:3Explanation:Only subarrays satisfying the conditions are [1], [1, 3, 2] and [3, 2].Problem Setter: Lalit Kundu",
