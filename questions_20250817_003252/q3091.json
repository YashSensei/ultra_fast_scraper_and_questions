  "text": "A group of cows grabbed a truck and ventured on an expedition deep\r\ninto the jungle. Being rather poor drivers, the cows unfortunately\r\nmanaged to run over a rock and puncture the truck's fuel tank. The\r\ntruck now leaks one unit of fuel every unit of distance it travels.To repair the truck, the cows need to drive to the nearest town (no\r\nmore than 1,000,000 units distant) down a long, winding road. On\r\nthis road, between the town and the current location of the truck,\r\nthere are N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) fuel stops where the cows can stop\r\nto acquire additional fuel (1..100 units at each stop).The jungle is a dangerous place for humans and is especially dangerous\r\nfor cows. Therefore, the cows want to make the minimum possible\r\nnumber of stops for fuel on the way to the town. Fortunately, the\r\ncapacity of the fuel tank on their truck is so large that there is\r\neffectively no limit to the amount of fuel it can hold. The truck\r\nis currently L units away from the town and has P units of fuel (1\r\n≤ P ≤ 1,000,000).Determine the minimum number of stops needed to reach the town, or\r\nif the cows cannot reach the town at all.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer t representing the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:Line 1: A single integer, NLines 2..N+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers\r\ndescribing a fuel stop: The first integer is the distance from\r\nthe town to the stop; the second is the amount of fuel\r\navailable at that stop.Line N+2: Two space-separated integers, L and POutputFor each test case, output a single integer giving the minimum number of fuel stops\r\nnecessary to reach the town. If it is not possible to reach\r\nthe town, output -1.ExampleInput:1\r\n4\r\n4 4\r\n5 2\r\n11 5\r\n15 10\r\n25 10Output:2Input detailsThe truck is 25 units away from the town; the truck has 10 units\r\nof fuel. Along the road, there are 4 fuel stops at distances 4,\r\n5, 11, and 15 from the town (so these are initially at distances\r\n21, 20, 14, and 10 from the truck). These fuel stops can supply\r\nup to 4, 2, 5, and 10 units of fuel, respectively.Output detailsDrive 10 units, stop to acquire 10 more units of fuel, drive 4 more\r\nunits, stop to acquire 5 more units of fuel, then drive to the town.",
