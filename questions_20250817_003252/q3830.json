  "text": "Jarin has got a new task. She has to connect towers by wire.GivenNumber of towersN(2 <= N <= 1000).The length of wireL(0 <= L <= 5000).Coordinates of each tower in 1D starting from left to right and each coordinate will be a positive distinct integer (0 <= a[i] <= 5000).Her task is to maximize the number of connected towers using that wire. But she has to make sure each tower is either connected with its left tower or its right tower or have no connection. She has to cut off the wire into particular sizes she wants to use.It so difficult task for her. So you must have to help her :) .InputInput starts with an integerT(â‰¤ 100), denoting the number of test cases.Each case starts with two integersNandL. Next line containsNspace separated integers.OutputFor each case, print the case number and expected answer.ExampleInput:1\r\n6 2\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6Output:Case 1: 4Problem Setter: Ajharul Islam BaridSpecial Thanks: Abu Zafar Newton.",
