A and B can contain any characters between A and J (capital letters).OutputPrint the number of strings satisfying the above criteria.\r\nC must also satisfy criteria of A and B. Any two adjacent\r\ncharacters in string C may neither be the same nor consecutive (i.e. the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters is greater than 1).ExampleInput:A J\r\nAA BCD\r\nABC DEFGOutput:8\r\n129\r\n1770",
