  "text": "Some of the secret doors contain a very interesting word puzzle. The team of\r\narchaeologists has to solve it to open  that doors. Because there is no\r\nother way to open the doors, the puzzle is very important for us.There is a large number of magnetic plates on every door. Every plate has one\r\nword written on it. The plates must be arranged into a sequence in such a way that\r\nevery word begins with the same letter as the previous\r\nword ends. For example, the word ``acm'' can be followed by the word\r\n\"motorola''. Your\r\ntask is to write a computer program that will read the list of words and\r\ndetermine whether it is possible to arrange all of the plates in\r\na sequence (according to the given rule) and consequently to open the door.InputThe input consists ofTtest cases. The number of them (T, equal to about 500) is given on\r\nthe first line of the input file.\r\nEach test case begins with a line containing a single integer numberNthat indicates the number of plates\r\n(1 ≤ N ≤ 100000). Then exactlyNlines follow,\r\neach containing a single word. Each word contains at least two\r\nand at most 1000 lowercase characters, that means only letters 'a'\r\nthrough 'z' will appear in the word. The same word may appear several\r\ntimes in the list.OutputYour program has to determine whether it is possible to arrange all the plates in\r\na sequence such that the first letter of each word is equal to the last\r\nletter of the previous word. All the plates from the list must be used, each\r\nexactly once. The words mentioned several times must be\r\nused that number of times.If there exists such an ordering of plates, your program should print \r\nthe sentence \"Ordering is possible.\". Otherwise, output\r\nthe sentence \"The door cannot be opened.\".ExampleSample input:3\r\n2\r\nacm\r\nibm\r\n3\r\nacm\r\nmalform\r\nmouse\r\n2\r\nok\r\nokSample output:The door cannot be opened.\r\nOrdering is possible.\r\nThe door cannot be opened.Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
