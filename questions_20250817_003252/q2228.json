(n might contain leading zeros.)0 ≤ k ≤ nif value of n is equal to k. then just print a new line.InputT: number of test cases.T lines follow each with n and k.OutputThe maximum possible number.ExampleInput:2\r\n1223 2\r\n8756 2Output:23\r\n87ExplanationNote that left to right order should be maintained. As in the example given answer is 23 not 32.",
