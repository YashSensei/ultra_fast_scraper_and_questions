There are balls in the boxes, and the number of all the balls in the boxes is not greater than n.The balls should be displaced in such a way that in each box there remains no more than one ball. In one move we can shift a ball from one box to one of it's neighbouring boxes.Write a program that:  reads from the standard input the number of boxes n and the arrangement of balls in the boxes,  computes the minimal number of moves necessary to displace the balls in such a way that in each box there remains no more than one ball,  writes the result in the standard output.InputThe first line of the input file contains an integer t representing the number of test cases (t ≤ 20). Then t test cases follows. Each test case has the following form:The first line contains one positive integer n - the number of boxesThe second line contains n nonnegative integer separated by single spaces. The i-th number is the number of balls in the i-th box.OutputFor each test case, output one nonnegative integer - the number of moves necessary to displace the balls in such a way that in each box there remains no more than one ball.ExampleInput:1\r\n12\r\n0 0 2 4 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 1Output:19",
