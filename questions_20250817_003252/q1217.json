  "text": "In his next interview Digo is given a binary string of N characters. A binary string is string consisting of only 0's and 1's. Digo can swap any adjacent pair of characters in one operation. Digo has to bring at least M 1's together starting at any position of the string. Help him count the minimum number of operations required to do so.It is guaranteed that there are at least M 1's present in the given string.InputFirst line contains single integer T. Number of test cases.Next 2 × T lines represent T test cases. Each test case is described by two lines; first line contains a single integer M and the second line contains the input binary string.OutputOutput T lines, one for each test case containing the answer for that case.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ N ≤ 500001 ≤ M ≤ NSum of N over all the cases is less than or equal to 50000.SampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n101001\r\n2\r\n101001Output:3\r\n1",
