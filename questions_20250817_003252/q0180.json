So he asked Subru the following question“How many ways are there to place a black and a white Queen on an M × N chessboard such that they do not attack each other? The queen can be moved any number of unoccupied squares in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.”Subru gave the answer in seconds for a given chess board of size M × N (M ≤ N). Can you repeat the same with your code?InputThe first line contains the integer “t” which indicates the number  of test cases. Each of the followingtlines contains two integers M and N separated by spaces (M ≤ N).OutputOutput for each case consists of one line: The number of ways of placing a black and a white queen on a M × N chess boardsuch that they do not attack each other.ConstraintsT ≤ 10000, 2 ≤ M ≤ 1010, 2 ≤ N ≤ 1010. and M ≤ N.Input:3\r\n5 5\r\n3 4\r\n2 2Output:280\r\n40\r\n0",
