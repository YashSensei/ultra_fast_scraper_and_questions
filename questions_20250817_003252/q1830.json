  "text": "You are given:a positive integer n,an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n,an increasing sequence of k integers 0 < s1< s2< ... < sk≤ 2n.What is the number of proper bracket expressions of length 2n with opening brackets appearing in positions s1, s2... sk?IllustrationSeveral proper bracket expressions:[[]][[[]][]]\r\n[[[][]]][][[]]An improper bracket expression:[[[][]]][]][[]]There is exactly one proper expression of length 8 with opening brackets in\r\npositions 2, 5 and 7.TaskWrite a program which for each data set from a sequence of several data sets:reads integers n, k and an increasing sequence of k integers from input,computes the number of proper bracket expressions of length 2n with opening\r\nbrackets appearing at positions s1,s2... sk,writes the result to output.InputThe first line of the input file contains one integer d, 1 ≤ d ≤ 10,\r\nwhich is the number of data sets. The data sets follow. Each data set occupies\r\ntwo lines of the input file. The first line contains two integers n and k\r\nseparated by single space, 1 ≤ n ≤ 19, 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The second\r\nline contains an increasing sequence of k integers from the interval [1; 2n]\r\nseparated by single spaces.OutputThe i-th line of output should contain one integer - the number of proper\r\nbracket expressions of length 2n with opening brackets appearing at positions s1,\r\ns2... sk.ExampleInput:5\r\n1 1\r\n1\r\n1 1\r\n2\r\n2 1\r\n1\r\n3 1\r\n2\r\n4 2\r\n5 7Output:1\r\n0\r\n2\r\n3\r\n2",
