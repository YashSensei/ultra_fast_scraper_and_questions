  "text": "Let's define Skas the increasing sequence a1, a2, a3... consisting of all those positive integers which are powers of K or sums of distinct powers of K.For example S3= {1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30...}Your task is given N and K find the Nthterm of the sequence Sk.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer T(1 ≤ T ≤ 104) representing the number of test cases. The next T lines consist of two numbers each one separated by a single space:K (3 ≤ K ≤ 9) and N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10200).OutputFor each test case print a single line, the Nthterm of the sequence Sk.ExampleInput:83 43 1004 35 126 77 2398 179 500Output:9981515043958399409748426822",
