Within a week the admins got bored of his habit and started losing interest in this topic. Ankur sir is very clever. He knows that every body loves to solve puzzles. To maintain their interest he decides to ask a puzzle based on the number of current members. This way he can still bug the admins about the increasing member count without making them feel bored. The puzzle says for the given member count N, tell me how how many smaller numbers (k ≥ 2) exist such that F(k) = 2 * k * k - 1 is a prime.InputFirst line gives T, the number of test casesEach of the next T lines give a number N.OutputPrint the output for every test case on a new lineConstraintsT ≤ 10002 ≤ N ≤ 10000000ExampleInput:1\r\n5Output:3",
