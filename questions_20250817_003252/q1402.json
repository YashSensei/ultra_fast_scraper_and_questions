  "text": "EnglishVietnameseBecause of its age, the City Hall has suffered damage to one of its walls.A matrix with M rows and N columns represents the encoded image of that wall,\nwhere 1 represents an intact wall and 0 represents a damaged wall (like in Figure-1).1110000111\n1100001111\n1000000011\n1111101111\n1110000111\n\nFigure-1To repair the wall, the workers will place some blocks vertically into\nthe damaged area. They can use blocks with a fixed width of 1 and different\nheights of {1, 2 ... M}.For a given image of the City Hall’s wall, your task is to determine how\nmany blocks of different heights are needed to fill in the damaged area\nof the wall, and to use the least amount of blocks.InputThere is only one test case. The case starts with a line containing two\nintegers M and N (1 <= M, N <= 200). Each of the following M lines contains\na string with length of N, which consists of “1”s\nand/or “0”s. These M lines represent the wall.OutputYou should output how many blocks of different heights are needed.\nUse separate lines of the following format:k Ckwhere k ∈ {1, 2 ... M} means the height of the block, and Ck means\nthe amount of blocks of height k that are needed. You should not output\nthe lines where Ck = 0. The order of lines is in the\nascending order of k.SampleInput5 10\n1110000111\n1100001111\n1000000011\n1111101111\n1110000111Output1 7\n2 1\n3 2\n5 1",
