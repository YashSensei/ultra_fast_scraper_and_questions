  "text": "Bom has a list of n favorite numbers which are birthday, driving license, passport number, etc After creating an email account, Bom wants to choose a password as the largest number P among all possible numbers generated by the combinations of k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) positive numbers in the favorite list so that P is divisible by 9.Your task is writing a program to help find P the password for Bom’s email.InputThe first line contains a positive integer T as the number of test cases in the input file. The following lines describe information of each test case including:One line containing two positive integers n and k,n following lines are n favorite numbers.OutputThe output file contains T lines; each line is the solution of the corresponding test case that is either password P or -1 in case of not finding a feasible number.LimitsT ≤ 301 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1001 ≤ all favorite numbers ≤ 106ExampleInput:2\r\n3 2\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n5 2\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5Output:-1\r\n54",
