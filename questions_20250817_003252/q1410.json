  "text": "EnglishVietnameseYou are working for Macrohard company in data structures department. After\r\nfailing your previous task about key insertion you were asked to write a\r\nnew data structure that would be able to return quickly k-th order statistics\r\nin the array segment.That is, given an array a[1 ... n] of different integer numbers, your\r\nprogram must answer a series of questions Q(i, j, k) in the form: \"What would\r\nbe the k-th number in a[i ... j] segment, if this segment was sorted?\"For example, consider the array a = (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4). Let the question\r\nbe Q(2, 5, 3). The segment a[2 ... 5] is (5, 2, 6, 3). If we sort this\r\nsegment, we get (2, 3, 5, 6), the third number is 5, and therefore the\r\nanswer to the question is 5.InputThe first line of the input contains n — the size of the array, and m —\r\nthe number of questions to answer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000).The second line contains n different integer numbers not exceeding 109by their absolute values — the array for which the answers should be given.The following m lines contain question descriptions, each description consists\r\nof three numbers: i, j, and k (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ j - i + 1) and\r\nrepresents the question Q(i, j, k).OutputFor each question output the answer to it — the k-th number in sorted\r\na[i ... j] segment.ExampleInput:7 3\r\n1 5 2 6 3 7 4\r\n2 5 3\r\n4 4 1\r\n1 7 3Output:5\r\n6\r\n3Note: a naive solution will not work!!!",
