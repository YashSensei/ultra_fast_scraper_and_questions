  "text": "You are given N (N ≤ 100 000) d-dimensional (1 ≤ d ≤ 5) points, each having integer coordinates (X1, X2 ... Xd). Then Q (Q ≤ 100 000) queries follow. For each query you are given a d-dimensional point (not necessarily from the given N) and you are to find the squared Euclidean distance to the closest point from the given N.The coordinates of all N+Q points are generated randomly between -1 000 000 000 and 1 000 000 000.The squared Euclidean distance between two points A and B is the sum of (A.Xi - B.Xi) × (A.Xi - B.Xi) for i=1, 2 ... d.InputThe first line contains three numbers - N, d and Q.The next N lines contain d integers each - the coordinates of a point.The next Q lines contain d integers each - the coordinates of a query point.OutputPrint the answer for each of the Q queries on separate lines.ExampleInput:2 2 2\r\n1 1\r\n2 2\r\n1 1\r\n3 3Output:0\r\n2",
