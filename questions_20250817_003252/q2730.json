  "text": "Mr. Abul is a big fan ofprime numbers. As a fan of prime numbers, he wants to know whether a prime numberPcan be expressed asdifference of two squared numbersor not.In other words you have to calculate two natural numbersXandYwhereP=X2-Y2For example, prime numberP= 5 can be expressed as 32- 22= 9 - 4 = 5, here X = 3 and Y = 2.InputInput starts with an integerT≤ 100, denoting the number of test cases.Each case contains an integerN(2 ≤ N ≤ 1018) denoting a prime number.OutputFor each case of input, print X and Y separated by a space if it is possible to express as difference of two squared numbers. Otherwise, print -1.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n5Output:-1\r\n2 1\r\n3 2",
