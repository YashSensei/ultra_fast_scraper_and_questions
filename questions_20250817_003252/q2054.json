  "text": "You've come across $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 200$) adorable little Foxlings, and they're hungry! Luckily, you happen to have $M$ ($1 \\leq M \\leq 200$) crackers on hand, and everyone knows that Foxen love crackers! You'd like to distribute all of your crackers, without splitting any of them, among the Foxlings - but you have to be careful. Foxling $i$ must be fed at least $A_i$ crackers, or it will remain hungry, but no more than $B_i$ of them, or it will become hyper ($1 \\leq A_i \\leq B_i \\leq 200$). You certainly don't want any hungry or hyper Foxlings on your hands, and you're curious as to how many ways this can be accomplished.There are $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 100$) scenarios as described above. For each one, you'd like to determine the number of different distributions of your crackers that would satisfy all of the Foxlings, modulo $10^9+7$ (as this value can be quite large).InputFirst line: 1 integer, $T$For each scenario:First line: 2 integers, $N$ and $M$Next $N$ lines: 2 integers, $A_i$ and $B_i$, for $i = 1..N$OutputFor each scenario:Line 1: 1 integer, the number of valid cracker distributions modulo $10^9+7$ExampleInput:22 51 42 63 52 22 92 3Output:30Explanation of SampleIn the first scenario, you can give either 1, 2, or 3 crackers to the first Foxling, and the remaining 4, 3, or 2 (respectively) to the second.In the second scenario, each Foxling must receive at least 2 crackers, while you only have 5 to give out, so you have no valid options.",
