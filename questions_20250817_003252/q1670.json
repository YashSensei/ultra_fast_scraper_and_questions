  "text": "Little Ben had just learned different bases in math. He learned very quickly how to add and subtract in multiple bases, so his teacher provided him with a worksheet to work on. Each section provided a different base and gave an example.Unfortunately, Little Ben's teacher forgot to write what base each question was in! Please help Little Ben do his homework; he'll be very grateful!InputThe first line of input contains an integern(1 ≤ n < 36) that indicates the amount of sections (test cases). Each test case is as follows:A - B = C\r\nI\r\nX1 op Y1 =\r\nX2 op Y2 =\r\n...\r\nXI op YI =whereA - B = Cis the correct example,I(1 ≤ I ≤ 1000) is the number of questions in that section,XiandYiare the operands of each problem (Xi= |Xi|,Yi= |Yi|), andopis either + or -, denoting addition or subtraction.OutputYour program should output in the following format:SECTION 1 (BASE b)X1 op Y1 = Z1X2 op Y2 = Z2...Xi op Yi = ZiSECTION 2 (BASE b)X1 op Y1 = Z1X2 op Y2 = Z2...Xi op Yi = Zi...SECTION N (BASE b)X1 op Y1 = Z1X2 op Y2 = Z2...Xi op Yi = ZiwhereZiis the solution toXi op Yi, andbis the base used. (2 ≤ b ≤ 36).If the base is ambiguous, use the smallest base for which the example is correct and the questions are valid.You may assume all solutions fit inside a 64-bit integer and that each base will appear at most once.ExampleInput:4\r\n110 - 101 = 1\r\n2\r\n1111111 + 1 =\r\n100 - 1 =\r\n177 + 1 = 200\r\n2\r\n7712347 + 7 =\r\n11111 + 7777 =\r\nZAP + DZ = ZOO\r\n1\r\nE + PI =\r\n10 + 1 = 11\r\n1\r\n5 + 5 =Output:SECTION 1 (BASE 2)\r\n  1111111 + 1 = 10000000\r\n  100 - 1 = 11\r\nSECTION 2 (BASE 8)\r\n  7712347 + 7 = 7712356\r\n  11111 + 7777 = 21110\r\nSECTION 3 (BASE 36)\r\n  E + PI = PW\r\nSECTION 4 (BASE 6)\r\n  5 + 5 = 14Noteslarge input/output data, be careful with certain languagesTricky input/output; please read problem statement carefully",
