At the kth turn, the robot turns to left if the kth character of s10is a 1, and to right otherwise. The figure below shows the whole path of the robot.The robot is placed at the origin (the small circle) and face east originally. It ends up at the coordinates (-32,32) (the small spot) after 2048 seconds. The path of the robot is known as a dragon curve, a pretty well-known pattern of fractal.If the robot is now programmed with input string s30(with identical initial conditions as above), it will keep moving and then stop after 231seconds. We want to know the location of the robot at any given time.InputInput consists of multiple problem instances. Each instance consists of a single non-negative integern, wherenâ‰¤ 109. The input data is terminated by a \"-1\". There will be fewer than 5000 test cases.OutputFor each input integern, print out the location of the robot right afternsecond since the robot starts its journey with input string s30. The location should be printed with the format \"(x,y)\" in a single line.ExampleInput:1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n2048\r\n1000000000\r\n-1Output:(1,0)\r\n(1,1)\r\n(0,1)\r\n(-32,32)\r\n(9648,-31504)",
