  "text": "Ada the Ladybug has just returned from her trips. She noted all her expenses. Sadly, she only had a small piece of paper so she had to keep it in a compressed form. The compressed form is just a very long number. To restore the expenses, simply sum all contiguous subsequences of the number. Since this number might be pretty big, you only have to output it modulo109+7(1000000007).Can you help her to restore the number?InputThe first and the only line of input contains the compressed sequence of digits ([0..9]):1 ≤ |s| ≤     2*106OutputPrint the sum of all contiguous subsequencesExample Input123Example Output164Example Input 2001Example Output 23Example Input 3105004400Example Output 3127807548Example Input 44774Example Output 46245Example Input 54369383968Example Output 5353343059Example Input 6447723168365033648256648424988Example Output 642233771",
