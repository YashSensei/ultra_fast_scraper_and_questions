While a good guy is preparing for the interview  described inILKQUERYyour boss gives you the job of preparing the  input/output for a new task.But as always, your boss changes his mind so quickly... He will give you an array of integers, but sometime, he will say you that the element at indexrof the original array must toggle his state between active (1) and inactive (0).Initially all elements start as active elements.Toggle the state of an element means to change it to active (1) if it was inactive, and change it to inactive (0) if it was active.Mixed with the toggle operations, he also will give you several queries, represented with three integers,i l kmeaning he wants to know how many active elements of valuekexist between indexesiandl(both inclusive).InputInput consists of one test case.The first line contains two integers,N(1 ≤  N  ≤  105) andQ(1 ≤ Q  ≤ 105).The next line containsNintegersai(-109≤ ai≤ 109).ThenQlines follow. Each of them starts with an integerqwhich can be 0 or 1. If it's 0, then three integersi l kfollow (0 ≤ i < N ; i ≤ l < N ; -109≤ k ≤ 109). If it's 1, then an integerrfollows, meaning you have to toggle the state of the element at indexr. (0 ≤ r < N).OutputFor each query starting with 0 (in the same order as the input) output a  single line with the answer to that query. That is, output the amount  of active elements of valuekbetween the indexesiandl(both  inclusive).ExampleInput:10 52 2 3 2 1 5 4 2 6 30 0 7 21 30 0 7 21 60 2 7 4Output:430",
