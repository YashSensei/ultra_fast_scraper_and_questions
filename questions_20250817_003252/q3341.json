  "text": "The Bluewater Security Company provides guards for clients with valuable    possessions. Bluewater has found that clients are interested in having    guards posted where they can see everything that is valuable merely by    turning their heads, and also like guards to be posted particularly close to    particularly valuable items. A sample site layout is shown above. Ignore the    three black dots for now. Various locations are labeled and assigned values.    For instance location A at coordinates (0,8) is the position of an item with    value 4. Locations showing a value 0, like G, do not have a valuable item.    The straight lines indicate corridors. For simplicity, corridors are modeled    as line segments with 0 width. A guard at an intersection point of several    corridors can see and therefore guard the items on each of the corridors. If    Bluewater were contracted to supply 3 guards, they might choose to post them    at the positions indicated with the small black dots. The guard not at an    already labeled position is at (15.5, 6). To model the desire for guards to    be closer to items of higher value, Bluewater calculates theriskto a valuable item to be the value of the    item times the minimum distance to a guard that canseethe item. Even if a guard is close to an    item that is around a corner, that guard doesnotaffect the risk to the item, since the    guard cannot see around a corner. In the diagram shown, the risks to the    items are A: 4×5=20, C: 4×2.5=10, D: 2×0=0, .... The largest risks are    for H: 50×7.5=375 and I: 50×7.5=375, so the maximum risk to any one item is    375. With this site layout, no arrangement of 3 guards would provide a lower    maximum risk, so this arrangement of 3 guards minimizes the maximum risk.    Bluewater would like to be able to tell any client who requests a particular    number of guards for a particular site layout, what the minimized maximum    risk will be.InputThe input will consist of one to sixteen data    sets, followed by a line containing only 0. On each line the data will    consist of blank separated tokens.The first line of a dataset contains integersp c g, wherepis the number of points specified,cis the number of corridors, andgis the number of guards to be    placed. Constraints are 1< p< 12; 0 <c< 12; 0 <g< 5.Next in the dataset are a total ofpgroups of four tokens, each consisting of a    capital letter and three nonnegative integersLx y    vindicating the point (x,y) with labelLcontains an item with valuev. Ifpis no greater than 6, these groups will all    be on one line. Ifpis greater    than 6, then the seventh and further groups will be on the next line. Labels    will be consecutive letters starting from A. All the numbers are less than    1000. Each of the points is unique. A value of 0 forvmeans there is no item of value there. The    number of locations with items of value will be at least as large as the     number of guards.The last line of a dataset containscstrings of letters, one for each corridor.    For each corridor the letters are labels for points along the corridor, in    order along the line segment from one end to the other, including both    endpoints, all intersection points with other corridors, and all locations    on the corridor with a valuable item. Each of the points given in the    dataset will lie on at least one of the corridors.OutputThere is one line of output for each data set.  If there    are not enough guards supplied to be able to see all the valuables, the line    is \"too few guards\".  Otherwise the line is an unsigned numberrrounded to two places beyond the decimal    point, where r is the minimum value over all placements ofgguards of the maximum \"risk\" to the    valuables.The first example dataset matches the illustration above, and the next    three examples only vary the number of guards.ExampleInput:11 5 3\r\nA 0 8 4 B 5 8 0 C 14 8 4 D 21 8 2 E 25 8 1 F 5 22 1\r\nG 5 20 0 H 11 12 50 I 20 0 50 J 19 10 5 K 25 4 5\r\nABCDE AG FGB GHCI JDK\r\n11 5 2\r\nA 0 8 4 B 5 8 0 C 14 8 4 D 21 8 2 E 25 8 1 F 5 22 1\r\nG 5 20 0 H 11 12 50 I 20 0 50 J 19 10 5 K 25 4 5\r\nABCDE AG FGB GHCI JDK\r\n11 5 1\r\nA 0 8 4 B 5 8 0 C 14 8 4 D 21 8 2 E 25 8 1 F 5 22 1\r\nG 5 20 0 H 11 12 50 I 20 0 50 J 19 10 5 K 25 4 5\r\nABCDE AG FGB GHCI JDK\r\n11 5 4\r\nA 0 8 4 B 5 8 0 C 14 8 4 D 21 8 2 E 25 8 1 F 5 22 1\r\nG 5 20 0 H 11 12 50 I 20 0 50 J 19 10 5 K 25 4 5\r\nABCDE AG FGB GHCI JDK\r\n3 3 1\r\nA 0 0 50 B 0 3 60 C 4 0 20\r\nAB CB CA\r\n0Output:375.00\r\n1250.00\r\ntoo few guards\r\n21.21\r\n150.00",
