  "text": "There are N numbers a[0], a[1] ... a[N - 1]. Initially all are 0. You have to perform two types of operations :Increase the numbers between indices A and B (inclusive) by 1. This is represented by the command \"0 A B\"Answer how many numbers between indices A and B (inclusive) are divisible by 3. This is represented by the command \"1 A B\".InputThe first line contains two integers, N and Q.\r\nEach of the next Q lines are either of the form \"0 A B\" or \"1 A B\" as mentioned above.OutputOutput 1 line for each of the queries of the form \"1 A B\" containing the required answer for the corresponding query.SampleInput:4 7\r\n1 0 3\r\n0 1 2\r\n0 1 3\r\n1 0 0\r\n0 0 3\r\n1 3 3\r\n1 0 3Output:4\r\n1\r\n0\r\n2Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 1000001 ≤ Q ≤ 1000000 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ N - 1",
