  "text": "You are given a matrix of size NxN containing only upper case letters. You have to perform two kinds of operations:Replace operation is to replace a row or column of the matrix with the given string.Count Operation returns the count of each letter in the required region.The operations are given as:0 x y str→ Replace y th row with string str, if x = 0 or update yth column with string str (top to bottom), if x = 11 x1 y1 x2 y2→ Count the number of each latter in the rectangular region of the matrix where (x1, y1) is top-left point of the rectangle and (x2, y2) is the bottom-right point of the rectangle.For every Count operation output the value of (1*number of A's + 2*number of B's + ... 26*number of Z's).InputThe first line of the input file contains T which denotes the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers N and q where N denotes size of the matrix and q denotes the number of queries. This is followed by NxN alphabetic matrix. The matrix is followed by q lines of queries, in the above given format.T <= 10N <= 500, Q <= 100000 <= x1 < N, 0 <= x2 < N, 0 <= y1 < N, 0 <= y2 < Nx1 <= x2, y1 <= y2Warning: Huge I/OOutputPrint the output for each query line by line.ExampleInput:1\r\n4 3\r\nABCD\r\nABCD\r\nABCD\r\nABCD\r\n1 0 0 3 3\r\n0 0 2 PQRS\r\n1 0 2 3 3Output:40\r\n58",
