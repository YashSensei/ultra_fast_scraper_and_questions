  "text": "An unbounded triangular grid is a plane covered by equilateral triangles:Two neighboring triangles in the grid form a rhomb. There are 3 types of such \r\n\trhombs:A grid polygon is a simple polygon which sides consist entirely of sides of \r\n\ttriangles in the grid. We say that a grid polygon is rhombastic if it can be \r\n\tpartitioned into internally disjoint rhombs of types A, B and C.As an example let's consider the following grid hexagon:This hexagon can be partitioned into 4 rhombs of type A, 4 rhombs of type B and \r\n\t4 rhombs of type C:For a given rhombastic grid polygon P compute the numbers of rhombs of types A, \r\n\tB and C in some correct partition.TaskWrite a program that:reads a description of a rhombastic grid polygon from the standard input,computes the numbers of rhombs of types A, B and C in some correct partition of \r\n\t\tthe polygon,writes the results to the standard output.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case the first line of the input contains an integer n (3 ≤ n \r\n\t≤ 50000) - the number of sides of a rhombastic grid polygon. Each of the \r\n\tnext n lines contains a description of one side of the polygon. The sides are \r\n\tgiven one by one in the clockwise order. No two consecutive sides of the \r\n\tpolygon lie on the same straight line. The description of a side consists of \r\n\ttwo integers d and k. Integer d says what is the direction of the side \r\n\taccording to the following figure:Integer k is the length of the polygon side measured in the number of sides of \r\n\tgrid triangles. Sum of all numbers k is not larger than 100000.OutputFor each test case the first and only line of the output contains three \r\n\tintegers separated by single spaces denoting the number of rhombs of type A, B \r\n\tand C respectively, in some partition of the input polygon.ExampleSample input:1\r\n6 \r\n1 2 \r\n2 2 \r\n3 2 \r\n4 2 \r\n5 2 \r\n6 2Sample output:4 4 4",
