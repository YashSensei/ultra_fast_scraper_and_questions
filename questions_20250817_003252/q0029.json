  "text": "Farmer John's N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) cows each reside in one of B (1 ≤ B ≤ 20) \r\nbarns which, of course, have limited capacity. Some cows really like their \r\ncurrent barn, and some are not so happy.FJ would like to rearrange the cows such that the cows are as equally happy \r\nas possible, even if that means all the cows hate their assigned barn.Each cow gives FJ the order in which she prefers the barns. A cow's happiness \r\nwith a particular assignment is her ranking of her barn. Your job is to find an \r\nassignment of cows to barns such that no barn's capacity is exceeded and the \r\nsize of the range (i.e., one more than the positive difference between the the \r\nhighest-ranked barn chosen and that lowest-ranked barn chosen) of barn rankings \r\nthe cows give their assigned barns is as small as possible.InputLine 1: Two space-separated integers, N and BLines 2..N+1: Each line contains B space-separated integers which are exactly \r\n1..B sorted into some order. The first integer on line i+1 is the number of the \r\ncow i's top-choice barn, the second integer on that line is the number of the \r\ni'th cow's second-choice barn, and so on.Line N+2: B space-separated integers, respectively the capacity of the first \r\nbarn, then the capacity of the second, and so on. The sum of these numbers is \r\nguaranteed to be at least N.OutputOne integer, the size of the minimum range of barn rankings the cows give \r\ntheir assigned barns, including the endpointsExampleInput:6 4\r\n1 2 3 4\r\n2 3 1 4\r\n4 2 3 1\r\n3 1 2 4\r\n1 3 4 2\r\n1 4 2 3\r\n2 1 3 2Output:2",
