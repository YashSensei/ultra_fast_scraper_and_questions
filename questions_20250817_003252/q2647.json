The description of n test cases follow. The description of a test case consists of two lines. The first line contains integer a (0 < a < 1012540), the second â€“ integer b (0 < b < 1012540). It is also known that all the numbers in the input file are the determinants of the square matrix of the form:OutputFor each test case print the greatest common divisor of integers a and b on a separate line.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n21\r\n6765\r\n610Output:1\r\n3\r\n5",
