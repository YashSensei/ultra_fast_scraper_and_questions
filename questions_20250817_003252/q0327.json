  "text": "You are given scales for weighing loads. On the left side lies a single stone \r\n\tof known weight W < 2N. You own a set of N different weights, \r\n\tweighing 1, 2, 4 ... 2N-1units of mass respectively. Determine \r\n\thow many possible ways there are of placing some weights on the sides \r\n\tof the scales, so as to balance them (put them in a state of equilibrium). \r\n\tOutput this value modulo a small integer D.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case, the first line contains three integers: N L D, where N \r\n\tdenotes the number of weights at your disposal, L is the length of the binary \r\n\trepresentation of number W, and D is the modulus (1 ≤ L ≤ N ≤ 1000000, \r\n\t2 ≤ D ≤ 100). The second line contains the value of W, encoded in the \r\n\tbinary system as a sequence of exactly L characters 0 or 1 without separating \r\n\tspaces.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the calculated number of possible \r\n\tweight placements, modulo D.ExampleInput:2\r\n6 4 6\r\n1000\r\n6 6 100\r\n100110Output:3\r\n5Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
