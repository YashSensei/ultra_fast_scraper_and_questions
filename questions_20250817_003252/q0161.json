Permutations with leading zeros are invalid.InputInput starts with a positive integer t<104in a single line, then t lines follow.Each of the t lines contains one positive integer n<107.OutputFor every n print the number of distinct prime permutations of n in a single line.ExampleInput:2\r\n13\r\n110Output:2\r\n1Hint:If your solution times out, you may try thetutorial versionwith a longer time limit.",
