  "text": "EnglishVietnameseHere, we want to solve path planning for a mobile robot cleaning a rectangular\nroom floor with furniture.Consider the room floor paved with square tiles whose size fits the cleaning\nrobot (1 Ã— 1). There are 'clean tiles' and 'dirty tiles', and the robot can\nchange a 'dirty tile' to a 'clean tile' by visiting the tile. Also there\nmay be some obstacles (furniture) whose size fits a tile in the room. If there\nis an obstacle on a tile, the robot cannot visit it. The robot moves to an\nadjacent tile with one move. The tile onto which the robot moves must be\none of four tiles (i.e., east, west, north or south) adjacent to the tile\nwhere the robot is present. The robot may visit a tile twice or more.Your task is to write a program which computes the minimum number of\nmoves for the robot to change all 'dirty tiles' to 'clean tiles', if ever possible.InputThe input consists of multiple maps, each representing the size and arrangement\nof the room. A map is given in the following format.w h\n    c11 c12 c13 ... c1w\n    c21 c22 c23 ... c2w\n    ...\n    ch1 ch2 ch3 ... chwThe integers w and h are the lengths of the two sides of the floor of the room\nin terms of widths of floor tiles. w and h are less than or equal to 20.\nThe character cyx represents what is initially on the tile with coordinates\n(x, y) as follows.'.' : a clean tile\n    '*' : a dirty tile\n    'x' : a piece of furniture (obstacle)\n    'o' : the robot (initial position)In the map the number of 'dirty tiles' does not exceed 10. There is only one 'robot'.The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros.OutputFor each map, your program should output a line containing the minimum\nnumber of moves. If the map includes 'dirty tiles' which the robot cannot reach,\nyour program should output -1.SampleInput:7 5\n.......\n.o...*.\n.......\n.*...*.\n.......\n15 13\n.......x.......\n...o...x....*..\n.......x.......\n.......x.......\n.......x.......\n...............\nxxxxx.....xxxxx\n...............\n.......x.......\n.......x.......\n.......x.......\n..*....x....*..\n.......x.......\n10 10\n..........\n..o.......\n..........\n..........\n..........\n.....xxxxx\n.....x....\n.....x.*..\n.....x....\n.....x....\n0 0Output:8\n49\n-1",
