  "text": "Let us introduce an algorithm with a functionCanEmpty()which takes a string P as a parameter and returnTRUEif it is possible to make P empty, otherwise returnFALSE.String P consists of only 0 and 1. The pseudo-code implementation ofCanEmpty()function is as follows.boolCanEmpty(String P){\r\n     while (P has at least one substring 100)\r\n     {\r\n         Chose any one substring 100 in P and delete it.\r\n     }\r\n     if (P is empty) returnTRUE;\r\n     else returnFALSE;\r\n}Now you are given a string S consisting of 0 and 1, you have to find the length of longest substring ofSthat can be made empty applyingCanEmpty()algorithm.As for example, let S=1011100000100S has only two sub-strings (bold) which can be made empty applyingCanEmpty()algorithm.The first substring will have the delete- sequence inCanEmpty()function :110000->100->emptyThe second substring will have the delete-sequence inCanEmpty()function:100->emptyThe length of first substring is 6 and second is 3. So, the required answer is 6.InputInput starts with an integerT (â‰¤ 100), denoting the number of test cases.Each case contains a string S. The size of string is at most200000.OutputFor each test case, print the case number and required answer.Sample   InputOutput   for Sample Input21011100000100111011Case 1:   6Case 2: 0Problem Setter: Md Abdul Alim, Dept. of Computer Science, Bangladesh University of Business & Technology",
