  "text": "There are n hens in a farm. The egg laying ability of all the hens decreases by 1 day after each time they lay an egg. (i.e. every hen will lay the next egg 1 day slower than the time it took to lay the previous egg)Let the initial egg laying ability of Hen[i] be D[i].Hen[i] lays its first egg on D[i]th day.Hen[i] lays its second egg on 2×D[i]+1th day.Hen[i] lays its third egg on 3×D[i]+3rd day.Hen[i] lays its fourth egg on 4×D[i]+6th day.Hen[i] lays its fifth egg on 5×D[i]+10th day.and so on.Givenn- the number of hens and the arrayD- the initial egg laying ability of the hens, find the minimum number of days required to produce at leastKeggs. You can safely assume that eggs neither gets damaged nor converted into hens.InputThe first line consists of integerst, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line consists two integersnandK. The next line consists ofnintegers representing the initial egg-laying ability of the hens.OutputFor each test case, find the minimum number of days required to produce at leastKeggs.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 1021 ≤ n ≤ 1031 ≤ K ≤ 1081 ≤ D[i] ≤ 108ExampleInput:3\r\n1 4\r\n1\r\n2 5\r\n2 5\r\n5 1000000\r\n1 2 3 4 5Output:10\r\n11\r\n20000500003Explanation of Test case #2There are 2 hens and we need to produce 5 eggsAt time 2, Hen 0 lays an egg.At time 5, Hen 0 and Hen 1 lay an egg each.At time 9, Hen 0 lays an egg.At time 11, Hen 1 lays an egg.",
