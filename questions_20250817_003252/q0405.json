  "text": "Xima hasNballs arranged together in a line, thei-th(1 ≤ i ≤ N)ball has a value ofAi.Tzaph asksQqueries to Xima. There are two types of queries:1 i k: The value of thei-th ball is changed intok. In other words,Ai= k.Take note that Aiand k could have a same value. In this case, Xima shouldn't do anything.2 i: Tzaph removes thei-th ball out from the line. Print the number of pairs(x, y)such that thex-thand they-thball is in the line,x < y, andAx= Ay. After this query, Tzaph returns thei-th ball back to the line in its original position.However, Tzaph asks too many queries and Xima has too many balls. Xima asks you to help him answer all of Tzaph's queries. Help him out!InputThe first line contains two integersNandQ.The second line consists ofNintegers, where thei-th integer representsAi.The nextQlines represents the queries with format explained in the description.OutputFor every second type of query, print the answer required.Constraints1 ≤ N, Q, Ai, k ≤ 105ExamplesInput 1:5 5\r\n1 2 3 4 5\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 5 4\r\n2 1\r\n1 2 4\r\n2 4Output 1:2\r\n1Input 2:1 3\r\n1\r\n2 1\r\n1 1 3\r\n2 1Output 2:0\r\n0",
