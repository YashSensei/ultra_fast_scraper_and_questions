SN(0 ≤ Si< 1,000,000,000), compute the number of distinct increasing subsequences of S with length K (1 ≤ K ≤ 50 and K ≤ N).InputThe first line contains the two integers N and K. The following N lines contain the integers of the sequence in order.OutputPrint a single integer representing the number of distinct increasing subsequences of S of length K, modulo 5,000,000.ExampleInput:4 3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n10Output:1The only increasing subsequence of length 3 is 1, 2, 10.",
