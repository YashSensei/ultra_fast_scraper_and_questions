  "text": "Given a number, output how many digits of that number the number is itself divisible by. Count all occurrences of such digits in the number, not just the first.For example, 12345 is divisible by 1, 3, and 5, so, the answer in this case must be 3.InputEach test case is a number between 1 and 10240.Outputfor each test case, output how many of its digits divide the number.ExampleInput:\r\n12345\r\n661232\r\n312\r\n730000000\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n3\r\n3\r\n3\r\n0",
