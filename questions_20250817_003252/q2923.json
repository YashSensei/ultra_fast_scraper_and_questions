  "text": "Dr. Sheldon Cooper builds a MVPD replication of himself which he calls a \"Mobile Virtual Presence Device\" (MVPD) that would go through all the hazards of life that he would otherwise have to experience while he stays behind in a \"secure, undisclosed location\". Now the MVPD is initially standing at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system, (0, 0). (More like Sheldon's spot (0, 0, 0, 0)). Then the MVPD makes N turns:On the first turn, the MVPD goes 1 unit to the right.On the second turn, the MVPD goes 2 units up.On the third turn, the MVPD goes 3 units to the left.On the fourth turn, the MVPD goes 4 units down.On the fifth turn, the MVPD goes 5 units to the right.And so on.Given an integer N, find the position of Sheldon's MVPD so that he won't get lost somewhere.Input FormatThe first line contains a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.For each test case, a single line contains a single integer - the value of N.Output format:For each test case output a single line, containing two integers - the coordinates of the MVPD after performing N turns.Constraints:1 ≤ T ≤ 100.1 ≤ N ≤ 109.Sample:Input:2\r\n3\r\n4Output:-2 2\r\n-2 -2",
