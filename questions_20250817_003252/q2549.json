  "text": "Given N distinct points in a plane, a point (x1, y1) is said to be dominating another point (x2, y2) if x1>=x2 and y1>=y2.The Dominance of a point is the absolute difference between 2 quantities – number of points dominated by this point and number of points not dominated by this point.(excluding itself)A Weird point is the point whose Dominance value is greater than or equal to a threshold value ‘k’. Find the number of such Weird Points among those N given points.InputFirst line gives T, the number of test cases.Each test case consists of 2 integers in first line, N and K, as specified above.Next N lines give the coordinates of N points in the plane. “Xi” and “Yi” are space separated.OutputOutput T lines, each containing the required answer.Constraints1<=T<=101<=N<=10^51<=Xi, Yi<=10^90<=K<=NExampleInput:1\r\n4 2\r\n3 17 52 86 7Output:2Problem Statement and Test Cases has been updated 2012-05-17  18:10:00.",
