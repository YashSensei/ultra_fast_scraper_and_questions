  "text": "R - NumbersR-numbers are numbers which have the property that they do not have the digit '0' and sum of every two adjacent digits of the number is prime. 123 is a R-number because 1+2 =3 and 2+3 =5 and 3, 5 are primes.How many R-numbers can be formed with at most length N?i.e. R-numbers of length 1 + R-numbers of length 2 + R-numbers of length 3 + ... R-numbers of length N.Length of a number = Number of digits in the number.Only four single digit numbers are R-numbers which are nothing but single digit primes 2, 3, 5, 7.Input SpecificationThe first line of the input file contains T which denotes the number of test cases. The next T lines contain an integer N â‰¤ 109.Output SpecificationPrint the numbers of R-numbers modulo 1000000007. [109+7];ExampleSample Input:2\r\n1\r\n2Sample Output:4\r\n33",
