  "text": "D is a given positive integer, consider the equation :X² = D×Y² + 1, with X and Y positive integers.Find the minimum numbers (X,Y) within all solutions.Sometimes it's possible, sometimes not!Examples :If D=2,  3² = 2×2² + 1, so X=3 and Y=2.If D=3,  2² = 3×1² + 1, so X=2 and Y=1.If D=4, it's impossible!InputThe input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.In each of the next T lines there is one integer D.OutputFor each test case, if possible print X and Y the answer of the problem for D, else \"-1\".ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4Output:3 2\r\n2 1\r\n-1ConstraintsT ≤ 10001 < D ≤ 107, the numbers D were randomly chosen. (but XerK modified one of them!)190 bytes of sub-optimal python code can get AC in less than 2.5 seconds, there's many rooms to make faster code.If you have TLE, you should first considerEQU2first.Edit (2017-02-11, after compiler updates) : New TL  at 1.5s. The Python awaited solution ends under 0.8s, pike or java around 1.4s. Some old AC might not keep their AC : here it's mid-pelling. The 'mid' is to be kept in consideration.",
