  "text": "You are given N points on a plane and your task is to find a pair of points with the smallest Euclidean distance between them.All points will be unique and there is only one pair with the smallest distance.InputFirst line of input will contain N (2<=N<=50000) and then N lines follow each line contains two integers giving the X and Y coordinate of the point. Absolute value of X,Y will be at most 10^6.OutputOutput 3 numbers a b c, where a, b (a<b) are the indexes (0 based) of the point pair in the input and c is the distance between them. Round c to 6 decimal digits.See samples for more clarification.Input:50 00 1100 452 39 9Output:0 1 1.000000Input:50 0-4 1-7 -24 51 1Output:0 4 1.414214",
