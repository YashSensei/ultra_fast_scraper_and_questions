  "text": "Lucky is fond of Number theory,\r\n one day he was solving a problem related to Euler Totient Function (phi) and\r\n found an interesting property of phi :\r\n phi(1) = 1, and for x > 1: phi(x) < x.So if we define a sequence with a0= x, and for n > 0: an= phi(an-1), this sequence will be constant equal to 1 starting from some point. Lets define depth(x) as minimal n such that an= 1.Now he is wondering how many numbers in a given range have depth equal to given numberk.\r\n As you are a good programmer help Lucky with his task.InputYour input will consist of a single integerTfollowed by a newline andTtest cases.Each test cases consists of a single line containing integersm,n, andk.OutputOutput for each test case one line containing the count of all numbers whose depth equals tokin given range [m,n].ConstraintsT < 100011 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1060 ≤ k < 20ExampleInput:5\r\n1 3 1\r\n1 10 2\r\n1 10 3\r\n1 100 3\r\n1 1000000 17Output:1\r\n3\r\n5\r\n8\r\n287876Explanation: suppose number is 5 ; its depth will be 3. ( 5 → 4 → 2 → 1 )Note: Depth for 1 is 0.",
