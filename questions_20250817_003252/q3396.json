  "text": "A histogram is a polygon composed of a sequence of rectangles aligned at a common base line.\r\nThe rectangles have equal widths but may have different heights.\r\nFor example, the figure on the left shows the histogram that consists of rectangles with the heights 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, measured in units where 1 is the width of the rectangles:Usually, histograms are used to represent discrete distributions, e.g., the frequencies of characters in texts.\r\nNote that the order of the rectangles, i.e., their heights, is important.\r\nCalculate the area of the largest rectangle in a histogram that is aligned at the common base line, too.\r\nThe figure on the right shows the largest aligned rectangle for the depicted histogram.Input SpecificationThe input contains several test cases.\r\nEach test case describes a histogram and starts with an integern, denoting the number of rectangles it is composed of.\r\nYou may assume that1 ≤ n ≤ 100000.\r\nThen follownintegersh1... hn, where0 ≤ hi≤ 1000000000.\r\nThese numbers denote the heights of the rectangles of the histogram in left-to-right order.\r\nThe width of each rectangle is1.\r\nA zero follows the input for the last test case.Output SpecificationFor each test case output on a single line the area of the largest rectangle in the specified histogram.\r\nRemember that this rectangle must be aligned at the common base line.ExampleInput:7 2 1 4 5 1 3 3\r\n4 1000 1000 1000 1000\r\n0Output:8\r\n4000",
