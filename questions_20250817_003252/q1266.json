  "text": "In the prime factorization of a numberN, there's two kinds of powers.\r\nEven powers, in red, are psychotic ones, and odd powers, in blue, are ordinary ones.\r\nWe'll sayNaPsychonumber if the count of even powers is\r\nstrictly greater than the count of odd powers, else anOrdinarynumber.\r\nFor example, ifN= 67500with prime factorization \r\n67500 =22x33x54. \r\n This number have 2even powersand 1odd power.\r\nSince 2>1, so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.InputThe first line of input contains an integerT, the number of test cases.Each of the nextTlines contains\r\n one integerN.OutputFor each test case, print ifNis Psycho or Ordinary number.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n4Output:Ordinary Number\r\nPsycho NumberConstraints0 < T < 10^4\r\n1 < N < 10^14Time limit is Ã—2 my top speed with Python3 language, it could be not easy with slow languages.\r\nO(N^.5 / log(N)) should give TLE even with fast languages. You are awaited to submit something between O(N^0.33 / log(N)) and O(N^0.25 / log(N)).\r\nYou can try before the quite similar \"tutorial\" problem :Psychobefore.\r\n@speed addicts : my top C timing is 0.02s.
