  "text": "In the Republic of Remoteland, the people celebrate their independence day every year. However, as it was a long long time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only thing people can remember is that today, the number of days elapsed since their independence (D) is a perfect square, and moreover it is the largest possible such number one can form as a product of distinct numbers less than or equal ton.As the years in Remoteland have 1,000,000,007 days, their citizens just needDmodulo 1,000,000,007. Note that they are interested in the largestD, not in the largestDmodulo 1,000,000,007.InputEvery test case is described by a single line with an integern, (1 ≤n≤ 10,000,000). The input ends with a line containing 0.OutputFor each test case, output the number of days ago the Republic became independent, modulo 1,000,000,007, one per line.ExampleInput:4\r\n9348095\r\n6297540\r\n0Output:4\r\n177582252\r\n644064736Problem setter: Javier Gómez Serrano",
