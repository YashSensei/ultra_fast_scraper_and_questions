  "text": "Factorial is one of the most attractive word this week, it is proposed to reload a famousproblem. Is it so boring?Sameer and Arpit want to overcome their fear of Maths and so they have been recently practicing Maths problems a lot. Aman, their friend has been helping them out. But as it goes, Sameer and Arpit have got bored of problems involving factorials. Reason being, the factorials are too easy to calculate in problems as they only require the residue modulo some prime and that is easy to calculate in linear time. So to make things interesting for them, Aman - The Mathemagician, gives them an interesting task. He gives them a prime numberPand an integerN(not so) close toP, and asks them to findN! modulo P. He asksTsuch queries.InputThe first line of input contains an integerT, the number of test cases.On each of the nextTlines, your are given\r\ntwo integersN, andPa prime number.OutputFor each test case, you have to printN! modulo P.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 5\r\n5 11\r\n21 71Output:2\r\n10\r\n6Constraints0 < T < 1040 < N < 4×10181 < P < 4×1018, a prime numberAbs(N-P) < 104Problem designed to be solvable using some 'slow' languages like Python (333B of code).\r\nIt is highly recommended to solve in a very fast way the original problem! Basic solution, even in fast language should give TLE.\r\nTime limit is set as sqrt(correct × basic). The \"basic\" code gave me 0.00s to the original problem with slow IO.\r\nIf you don't find this reload edition hard enough, please consider thechallenge editionwith more serious constraints.\r\n;-) Have fun.",
