  "text": "Some numbers have a curious property: when rotating the number to the right,\r\nthe new number is the double of the original. Rotating the number to\r\nthe right means choosing the last digit and moving it to the beginning of the number,\r\nas the leftmost digit. For example, the number 421052631578947368 when\r\nrotated to the right gives 842105263157894736, which is the double\r\nof the original. These numbers are expressed in the decimal system. In any\r\nnumeral system such numbers exist, for example, in the binary (base 2)\r\nnumeral system, numbers 01 and 0101 have this property.\r\nNote that leading zeros are required in this case.Write a program that, for any given base B (2 ≤ B ≤ 250), finds the\r\nsmallest number in that numeral system which has this property. Try not to\r\nprecompute the numbers, the solution is very easy and pretty.InputThe input consists of several test cases. The first line contains an\r\ninteger T (T ≤ 20), the number of test cases. The following T lines\r\ncontain one number B, each.OutputFor each number B, output one or more numbers separated by a blank\r\nspace that represent the digits in base B (written as decimal numbers) of the smallest number which has\r\nthis property.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n10\r\n35Output:0 1\r\n0 5 2 6 3 1 5 7 8 9 4 7 3 6 8 4 2 1\r\n11 23Output ExplanationIn example #1:The initial number (when converted to decimal system): 0 × 21+ 1 × 20= 1After applying the rotation: 1 × 21+ 0 × 20= 2.In example #3:The initial number (when converted to decimal system): 11 × 351+ 23 × 350= 408After applying the rotation: 23 × 351+ 11 × 350= 816.",
