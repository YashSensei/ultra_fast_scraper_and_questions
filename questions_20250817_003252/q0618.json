  "text": "You are given anN×Nmatrix with 0 and 1 values. You can swap any twoadjacentrows of the matrix.Your goal is to have all the 1 values in the matrix below or on the main diagonal. That is, for each X where 1 ≤ X ≤ N, there must be no 1 values in row X that are to the right of column X.Return the minimum number of row swaps you need to achieve the goal.InputThe first line of input gives the number of cases,T.Ttest cases follow.The first line of each test case has one integer,N. Each of the nextNlines containsNcharacters. Each character is either 0 or 1.OutputFor each test case, outputCase #X: KwhereXis the test case number, starting from 1, andKis the minimum number of row swaps needed to have all the 1 values in the matrix below or on the main diagonal.You are guaranteed that there is a solution for each test case.Limits1 ≤T≤ 601 ≤N≤ 8ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n10\r\n11\r\n3\r\n001\r\n100\r\n010\r\n4\r\n1110\r\n1100\r\n1100\r\n1000Output:Case #1: 0\r\nCase #2: 2\r\nCase #3: 4",
