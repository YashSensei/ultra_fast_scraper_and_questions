  "text": "For a string of n bits x1, x2, x3 ... Xn the adjacent bit count of the string (AdjBC(x)) is given byX1*X2 + X2*X3 + X3*X4 + ... + Xn-1 * Xnwhich counts the number of times a 1 bit is adjacent to another 1 bit. For example:AdjBC(011101101) = 3AdjBC(111101101) = 4AdjBC(010101010) = 0Write a program which takes as input integers n and k and returns the number of bit strings x of n bits (out of 2ⁿ) that satisfy AdjBC(x) = k. For example, for 5 bit strings, there are 6 ways of getting AdjBC(x) = 2:11100, 01110, 00111, 10111, 11101, 11011InputThe first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ≤ P ≤ 1000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set is a single line that contains the data set number, followed by a space, followed by a decimal integer giving the number (n) of bits in the bit strings, followed by a single space, followed by a decimal integer (k) giving the desired adjacent bit count. The number of bits (n) will not be greater than 100 and the parameters n and k will be chosen so that the result will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.OutputFor each data set there is one line of output. It contains the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the number of n-bit strings with adjacent bit count equal to k.ExampleInput:101 5 22 20 83 30 174 40 245 50 376 60 527 70 598 80 739 90 8410 100 90Output:1 62 634263 18612254 1682125015 448747646 1609167 229373088 991679 1547610 23076518",
