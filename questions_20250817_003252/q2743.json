Each move consists of subtracting a perfect square (not less than 1) from the number, the player who faces 0 loses. You are given a number N, you have to find out whether A can win the game, if both A and B play optimally.InputThe first line contains T - the number of test cases. The next T lines contain a number n.OutputFor each test case, print \"Win\" if A can win the game, or else print \"Lose\", separated by new line.Constraints1 ≤ T; N ≤ 105ExampleInput:5\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n1\r\n10Output:Win\r\nLose\r\nWin\r\nWin\r\nLose",
