  "text": "The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the following relation:F(0) = 0F(1) = 1F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), N ≥ 2Your task is very simple. Given two non-negative integers N and M, you have to calculate the sum (F(N) + F(N + 1) + ... + F(M)) mod 1000000007.InputThe first line contains an integer T (the number of test cases). Then, T lines follow. Each test case consists of a single line with two non-negative integers N and M.OutputFor each test case you have to output a single line containing the answer for the task.ExampleInput:3\r\n0 3\r\n3 5\r\n10 19Output:4\r\n10\r\n10857ConstraintsT ≤ 10000 ≤ N ≤ M ≤ 109",
