  "text": "The company you work in has got a secret job to do. Just a few persons know what it is all\r\nabout. To keep a secret every programmer works on a small part of the project.Your job is as follows. You are given a matrix of integer numbers with N rows and M columns.\r\nAlso two integer numbers A and B are given. Your task is to find a number of submatrices of\r\na given matrix with the sum of elements between A and B inclusively.InputThe first line contains two integer numbers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 250).\r\nAfter that matrix description follows. N lines with M numbers each. The last line contains two\r\ninteger numbers A and B (-109≤ A ≤ B ≤ 109). All numbers separated with spaces.\r\nIt is guaranteed that for every submatrix the absolute value of the sum of its elements will not exceed 109.OutputWrite to the output the number of submatrices of a given matrix with sum of their elements between A and B inclusively.ExampleInput:3 3\r\n1 0 0\r\n0 1 0\r\n0 0 1\r\n1 3Output:26",
