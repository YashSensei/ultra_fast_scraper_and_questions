  "text": "Recently Mr. Avantgarde has been assigned the task of delivering doughnuts. He borrowed an electric car for this task. There are N houses and each house has a charging station. There is at least one path of roads connecting each pair of houses. A trip from one house to any other must be completed using at most C rechargings. Car should always be recharged at the beginning of each trip (this counts as one of the C rechargings). As you know that Mr. Avantgarde is a lazy guy, Given the road network and C, compute the minimum range required of the electric car.Note: With one recharging, the car can travel a distance equal to its range.InputInput begins with one integer T (0 < T < 6) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing three integers N, C, and M (1 < N < 101, 0 < C < 101), where N and C are number of houses and number of rechargings. Next follow M lines each with three integers u, v and d (0 ≤ u, v < N, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ d ≤ 109) indicating that house u and v (0-indexed) are connected bidirectionally with distance d.OutputFor each test case, output minimum range required in each line.SampleInput:2\r\n4 2 4\r\n0 1 100\r\n1 2 200\r\n2 3 300\r\n3 0 400\r\n10 2 15\r\n0 1 113\r\n1 2 314\r\n2 3 271\r\n3 4 141\r\n4 0 173\r\n5 7 235\r\n7 9 979\r\n9 6 402\r\n6 8 431\r\n8 5 462\r\n0 5 411\r\n1 6 855\r\n2 7 921\r\n3 8 355\r\n4 9 113Output:300\r\n688",
