  "text": "FJ has N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000) cows and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 50,000) bulls. Given a list of P (1 ≤ P ≤ 150,000) potential matches between a cow and a bull, compute the greatest number of pairs that can be matched. Of course, a cow can be matched to at most one bull, and vice versa.InputThe first line contains three integers, N, M, and P. Each of the next P lines contains two integers A (1 ≤ A ≤ N) and B (1 ≤ B ≤ M), denoting that cow A can be matched with bull B.OutputPrint a single integer that is the maximum number of pairs that can be obtained.ExampleInput:5 4 6\r\n5 2\r\n1 2\r\n4 3\r\n3 1\r\n2 2\r\n4 4Output:3Cow 1 can be matched to bull 2, cow 3 to bull 1, and cow 4 to bull 3.Note: see alsohttp://www.spoj.com/problems/FASTFLOW/.",
