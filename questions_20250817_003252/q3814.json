  "text": "Traveling by car can sometimes be very boring. The natural cure for this boredom is to play a word\r\ngame. In the following example the winner is he or she who has won the most rounds when the car stops.\r\nEach round starts with someone reading out loud the three letters on the license plate of an oncoming\r\ncar. Whoever is first to say a word containing those letters in the same order wins the round. On the\r\nlast road trip you failed miserably in this game, but this time you will be more prepared.\r\nFor each set of three letters find the first word in a dictionary that contains these letters in the same\r\norder.InputThe first line of input contains two positive integers (N ≤ 5000) and (M ≤ 10000), the number of words\r\nin the dictionary and the number of license plates to be handled. Each of the following N lines contains\r\na word from the dictionary, a string no more than 100 characters long containing only lower case letters\r\nfrom the English alphabet. This is followed by M lines each containing a string of three uppercase letters\r\nfrom the English alphabet, representing a license plate.OutputFor each license plate in the input you should output one line containing either the first valid word in\r\nthe dictionary or the sentence \"No valid word\" if no such word exists.ExampleInput:5 3\r\nbanana\r\ncar\r\nsand\r\nuncharacteristically\r\ncounterrevolutionaries\r\nRRR\r\nDNA\r\nSNDOutput:counterrevolutionaries\r\nNo valid word\r\nsand",
