  "text": "Drawing stars on the last page of a notebook is a very entertaining hobby. Did you know these cute \"stars\" are actually called polygrams?Given a regular polygon withpvertices, we define apolygramp/q, as the resultant polygon obtained after connecting every i-th vertex with the (i+q)-th vertex.You may know the polygram 5/2 aspentagramAnother example is thehexagram6/2. Given that 6 and 2 are not coprime, this polygram is composed by two 3/1 polygramsGiven a regular polygon with p vertices, its radius R (the distance from its center to any vertex) and a number q, can you calculate the area of the polygram p/q?It is guaranteed that the resultant polygon will not be degenerated, i.e q ≠ p/2 and q ≠ pInputThe first and only line of the input contains three integersp,qandrOutputPrint in a single line the area of the resultant polygram p/q with radius r. Print the answer with exactly five decimal placesExampleInput:5 4 2Output:9.51057Input:10 4 5Output:40.61496Constraints3 ≤ p ≤ 1031 ≤ q < p1 ≤ r ≤ 100q ≠ p/2 and q ≠ p",
