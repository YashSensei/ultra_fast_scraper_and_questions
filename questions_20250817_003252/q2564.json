  "text": "Mr. B, Mr. G, Mr. M and their coach Professor S are planning their way to Warsaw for the ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of the four has a square-shaped suitcase with side length Ai(1 ≤i≤ 4) respectively. They want to pack their suitcases into a large square box. The heights of the large box as well as the four suitcases are exactly the same. So they only need to consider the large box’s side length. Of course, you should write a program to output the minimum side length of the large box so that the four suitcases can be put into the box without overlapping.InputEach test case contains only one line containing 4 integers Ai(1 ≤i≤ 4, 1 ≤ Ai≤ 1,000,000,000) indicating the side length of each suitcase.OutputFor each test case, display a single line containing the case number and the minimum side length of the large box required.ExampleInput:2 2 2 2\r\n2 2 2 1Output:Case 1: 4\r\nCase 2: 4ExplanationFor the first case, all suitcases have size 2×2. So they can perfectly be packed in a 4×4 large box without wasting any space.For the second case, three suitcases have size 2×2 and the last one is 1×1. No matter how to rotate or move, you could find the side length of the box must be at least 4.",
