  "text": "The number N is called “Psycho Number”. Psycho Number is calculated as follows:First, If we factorize N, then we have some prime and their power. Assume that, there are M powers. From M powers, you should count the number of even and odd powers. Then if the number of even power is strictly greater than odd power, then we call the number N is “Psycho Number”, otherwise the number N is call “Ordinary Number”.As for example, if N = 67500 then prime factorization,67500 = 22× 33× 54.Count even powers and odd powers. This number have 2 even power (2, 4) and 1 odd power (3). Since even power 2 (2, 4) is greater than odd power 1 (3), so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.bool isPsycho( long long K, long long b, long long p)\r\n{\r\n       N = numberoftrailingzeros(K!) * lastdigit(bp);\r\n       if (N == psychonumber)\r\n           return true;\r\n       else\r\n           return false;\r\n}For example, if k = 10, b = 12, p = 1 then the N is 4 and it's a psycho number.10! = 3628800, number of trailing zeros is 2.121= 12, last digit is 2.so N = 4 then 4 = 22. Even power is greater than odd power, so the number 4 is a Psycho Number.Input:An integerT(1 ≤T≤ 105) denoting the number of test cases followed by T lines. Each line containingK(1 ≤K≤ 4×106),b(0 ≤b≤ 104), andp(0 ≤p≤ 1017).Output:For each case print “Psycho Number” or “Ordinary Number”.SampleInput2\r\n5 2 5\r\n10 12 1OutputOrdinary Number\r\nPsycho NumberNote : 0 and 1 is not a psycho number.Psycho 1:PsychoPsycho 3:Make PsychoPsycho 4:Psycho34 (easy)Problem setter:Shipu Ahamed, Dept. of CSE,Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT)",
