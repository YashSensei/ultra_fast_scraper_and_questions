While watching the tutorials on Bit masking with his friendGeorge Boole, an idea came upon the mind ofGeorge. As being the inventor of the Boolean algebra,George Booleinvented a game to trickXOXO, who always prefer assumptions than proof.Georgenamed the game asXUDOKU. The game consists of a3 × N matrices. Where 3 is the constant number of rows and N is the number of columns. Initially the first row is filled with N integers. To win the tricky game,XOXOhas to fill the remaining two rows with some integers in such a way that, the following conditions are true.X(3, i)= X(1, i)⊕ X(2, i); for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ N).X(3, i)= X(3, i + 1)& X(3, i); for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ N - 1).The number sequence of the 2ndrow should belexicographically smallest.The number sequence of the 3rdrow should benon-decreasing.(X(i, j)means the j-th element of the i-th row of the XUDOKU matrices).InputThe first line contains G (1 ≤ G ≤ 1000), the number of games to be played.The second line contains N (2 ≤ N ≤ 2×105), the width of the XUDOKU board. I.e. number of columns.The Third line contains N integers of the First row. X(1, j)(0 ≤ X(1, j)< 230)OutputFor each G, you have to print the output in the following manner.Game #GiX(1, i)X(1, i + 1)X(1, i + 2)X(1, i + 3)X(1, i + 4)... X(1, N)X(2, i)X(2, i + 1)X(2, i + 2)X(2, i + 3)X(2, i + 4)... X(2, N)X(3, i)X(3, i + 1)X(3, i + 2)X(3, i + 3)X(3, i + 4)...
