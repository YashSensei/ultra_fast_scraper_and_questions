  "text": "There areNstacks of boxes, all boxes have same dimensions as 1 unit. The height of a stack is defined as the number of boxes in it. The initial height ofithstack is given ashi. We need to equalize the heights of stacks by adding, removing or moving the boxes across the stacks.The cost of each operation is defined as following:Add a box on top of a stack costsA.Remove a box from top of a non-empty stack costsR.Moving a box from top of non-empty stack to top of another stack costsM.InputFirst line contains one integerN.Second line contains 3 integers the costsA, R, M.Third line contains theNintegers as heightshiforithstack.1 <= N <= 1050 <= A, R, M <= 1040 <= hi<= 109OutputOne integer in a line - the minimum cost of equalising the heights of all stack by using above operations.ExampleInput:5\r\n1 2 2\r\n5 5 3 6 5Output:3(Move 1 box from 4th stack to 3rd stack now height are (cost 2) → 5 5 4 5 5 → now add one box on 3rd stack (cost 1), total cost = 3.",
