  "text": "After Maryanna found the treasure buried by 27 pilots in a secret cave, she wanted to leave there immediately. Unfortunately, finding the door closed because of the overweight treasure she carried, she had to find out the password of the lock. She remembered someone had told her the password is anN-digit natural decimal integer (without extra leading zeroes), and theNleast significant digits of any positive integral power of that integer is same as itself. She, being a smart girl, came up with all the possible answers within 1 minute. After a few times of tries, she escaped from that cave successfully. To show your intelligence you may solve the same task with your computer within only 10 seconds!InputThe first line containsT(T<= 1000), the number of test cases.Tlines follow, each contains a single positive integerN(N<= 500).OutputFor each test case, output a single line, which should begin with the case number counting from 1, followed by all the possible passwords sorted in increasing order. If no such passwords exist, outputImpossibleinstead. See the sample for more format details.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n1Output:Case #1: 25 76\r\nCase #2: 0 1 5 6",
