  "text": "EnglishVietnameseConsider a positive integer X, and let S be the sum of all positive integer\r\ndivisors of 2004X. Your job is to determine S modulo 29 (the remainder of the\r\ndivision of S by 29).Take X = 1 for an example. The positive integer\r\ndivisors of 20041are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 167, 334, 501, 668, 1002 and 2004.\r\nTherefore S = 4704 and S modulo 29 is equal to 6.InputThe input consists of several test cases. Each test case contains a line\r\nwith the integer X (1 ≤ X ≤ 10000000). A test case of X = 0 indicates\r\nthe end of input, and should not be processed.OutputFor each test case, in a separate line, please output the result of S modulo 29.SampleInput:1\r\n10000\r\n0Output:6\r\n10",
