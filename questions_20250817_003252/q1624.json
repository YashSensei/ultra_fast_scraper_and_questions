  "text": "A new mighty weapon has just been developed, which is so powerful that it can\r\nattack a sector of indefinite size, as long as the center of the circle containing the\r\nsector is the location of the weapon. We are interested in developing a fire-control\r\nsystem that calculates firing-solutions automatically.The following example gives an example of a firing solution:Here the firing region is the sector ABC that covers six points: A, B, C, D, E, H.You may further assume that the weapon is always located at point (0, 0), no\r\ntargets will be on the point (0, 0) and the coordinates of the targets will be distinct.A firing solution is calledeffectiveif and only if it covers a minimum of K points\r\nout of N given points (targets) on the two-dimensional Cartesian plane. Furthermore,\r\nsince the cost of a particular fire solution is in direct proportion to the size of the area\r\nit covers, a firing could be quite costly; thus we are only interested in the optimal\r\nfiring solution with the minimum cost.InputThere are multiple test cases in the input file.Each test case starts with two non-negative integers, N and K (1 ≤ N ≤ 5000, K ≤ N), followed by N lines each containing two integers, X, and Y,\r\ndescribing the distinct location of one target. It is guaranteed that the absolute value\r\nof any integer does not exceed 1000.Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with N = 0 and K = 0\r\nindicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.OutputFor each test case, please print the required size (to two decimal places), in the\r\nformat as indicated in the sample output.SampleInput3 1\r\n0 1\r\n1 0\r\n-5 -6\r\n\r\n3 2\r\n0 2\r\n2 0\r\n-5 -6\r\n\r\n0 0OutputCase #1: 0.00\r\nCase #2: 3.14",
