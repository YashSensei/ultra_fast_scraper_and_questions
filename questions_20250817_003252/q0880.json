  "text": "Bob likes to draw camels: with a single hump, two humps, three humps, etc. He draws a camel by connecting points on a coordinate plane. Now he's drawing camels withthumps, representing them as polylines in the plane. Each polyline consists ofnvertices with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ... (xn,yn). The first vertex has a coordinatex1= 1, the secondx2= 2, etc. Coordinatesyimight be any, but should satisfy the following conditions:there should bethumps precisely, i.e. such indexesj(2 ≤j≤n- 1), so thatyj- 1<yj>yj+ 1,there should be preciselyt- 1 such indexesj(2 ≤j≤n- 1), so thatyj- 1>yj<yj+ 1,no segment of a polyline should be parallel to theOx-axis,allyiare integers between 1 and 4.For a series of his drawings of camels withthumps Bob wants to buy a notebook, but he doesn't know how many pages he will need. Output the amount of different polylines that can be drawn to represent camels withthumps for a given numbern.InputThe first line of input contains the number of test cases, N.Each test case contains a pair of integersnandt(3 ≤n≤ 20, 1 ≤t≤ 10).OutputFor each testcase, output the required number of camels withthumps.ExampleInput:1\r\n6 1Output:6NoteIn the first sample test sequences ofy-coordinates for six camels are: 123421, 123431,\r\n123432, 124321, 134321 and 234321 (each digit corresponds to one value ofyi).",
