  "text": "Given a stringSwhich contains only digit-characters. How many  subsequences can be obtained from S such that every digit is strictly  greater than all previous digits in that subsequence.As for example if S=7598 then there are 8 subsequences which follow  the above constraint. These are 7, 5, 9, 8, 79, 78, 59, 58. Notice that 7598 is  not a required subsequence because 7 > 5 and 9 > 8.Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another  sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the  remaining elements.InputInput starts with an integerT (â‰¤ 1000), denoting the number of test cases. Each case contains a stringS. The length of S does not exceed10000. S does not contain any leading zeros.OutputFor each case, print the a string(without quotes)\"Case i: \"followed by number of subsequences where \"i\" is test case number. Answer may be very large, so output itmodulo 109+7.ExampleInput:247598Output:Case 1: 1Case 2: 8",
