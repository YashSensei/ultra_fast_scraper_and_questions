As Charu is poor in counting he wants your help, Given input \"N\", give the number of ways of depositing \"N\" rupees using coins of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, and 2.0 rupees. Since the answer can be really large, output the remainder when the answer is divided by 1000000007.InputFirst line will be t, number of test cases (T ≤ 10000). The next t lines, each line contains N (N ≤ 109).OutputThe output should contain one line per test case, representing the answer to the given problem.ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n2Output:4\r\n10ExplanationIn first case {0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25}, {0.50, 0.25, 0.25}, {1}, {0.50, 0.50}",
