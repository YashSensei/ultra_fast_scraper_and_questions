  "text": "John and James planned to play a game with coins. John has 20 coins and he places it on the table in a random manner (i.e. either with heads(1) or tails(0) facing up). John asked James to convert all heads into tails in minimum number of flips with the condition that if a coin is flipped the coins present immediately to the right and left of the chosen coin should also be flipped.InputA single line with 20 space-separated integersOutputThe minimum number of coin flips necessary to convert all heads into tails (i.e. to 0). For the inputs given, it will always be possible to find some combination of flips that will manipulate the coins to 20 tails.ExampleInput:0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0Output:3Explanation of the SampleFlip coins 4, 9, and 11 to make them all tails:0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [initial state]0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [after flipping coin 4]0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [after flipping coin 9]0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 [after flipping coin 11]",
