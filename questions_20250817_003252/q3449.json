  "text": "Consider the following game. The game is played on a  5 x 5 board.  Initially  every  array  cell  has  a  piece \r\nin  it.  Two players  remove pieces alternatively  from  the  board.  The player  can  remove  any  number  of  consecutive pieces  in a row or column.\r\nFor example,  in  the configuration depicted below where one  indicates  a \r\npiece,  the  player  can  either  remove  one  piece  (A1,A2,  orB1),  or remove two pieces (A1andA2, orA1andB1) simultaneously. The game ends when one player is forced to take the\r\nlast piece, and the other player wins the game.12345A11000B10000C00000D00000E00000Write  a  program  that  evaluates  board  configurations  from  this  game.  \r\nThe  program must  output  \"winning\" when there exists a winning move\r\nthat no matter how the opponent responds, it will force the opponent to take\r\nthe last piece. Otherwise, the program must output \"losing\".InputThe first line containsn, the number\r\nof test cases.  For each test case, a 5x5 grid\r\nof an initial game configuration is shown.OutputFor each case, output \"winning\" or \"losing\".ExampleInput:1 \r\n1 0 0 0 0 \r\n1 1 0 0 0 \r\n1 1 1 0 0 \r\n1 1 1 1 0 \r\n1 1 1 1 1Output:winning",
