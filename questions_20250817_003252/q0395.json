  "text": "You are given the polynomial F(x) as the sum of monomials. Each monomial has the form:[coefficient*]x[^degree] or [coefficient]wherecoefficientanddegreeare integers such that -30000 ≤coefficient≤ 30000, 0 ≤degree≤ 6. The parameters given in [] can be skipped.In this problem you have to find all solutions of the equation: F(x)=0.Inputt– the number of test cases, thenttest cases follow. [t≤ 100]Each line contains one polynomialF(x)given as stringsin the form described above.The length of stringsis not more than 300 characters.OutputFor each test case output all solutions (including repeated) of the given equation in non-decreasing order. All solutions lie within the interval [-100.0; 100.0]. Each solution must be given with an error of not more than 0.01. It's guaranteed that all solutions are real, not complex.ExampleInput:2\r\nx^4-6*x^3+11*x^2-6*x\r\n-x^2+2*x-1Output:0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00\r\n1.00 1.00",
