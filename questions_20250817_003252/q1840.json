So what we all\r\nneed, is a good editor.\r\nHere are the functions that the editor should have:'\\n': begin a new line. If the last line was empty, stop\r\nprocessing and print out all lines.'d': copy all characters from the current line, and append them\r\nafter\r\nthe last character in this line. For example, if current line contains\r\nab, and d is pressed two times, the result will be ababababany other character: append it to the current line.Please note, that the solution may only be submitted in Brainf**k or\r\nIntercal.InputThere is exactly one test case. You can assume, that there is no key press of 'd' when the line is still empty.OutputPrint the output that the editor described above would produce on the given input. You can assume, that no line is created with more than 150 characters.ExampleInput:sample-test-dd-d-ddend signalled by two newlinesOutput:sample-test--------------------------------------------enen signalleenen signalle by two newlines",
