  "text": "As you might know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She needs to choose some species of vegetables. Each vegetable has four important attributes. We say that a vegetable is worse than another vegetable, if all of its four attributes are greater.She wants to eliminate the list of vegetables, so only vegetables, which are not worse than any other vegetables remains.InputThe first line contains integer1 ≤ N ≤ 2×105Each of the nextNlines contains four integers1 ≤ X, Y, Z, W     ≤ N. It is guaranteed, that allXattributes are distinct for all vegetables. The same is true forY, ZandW(so in fact, there are four permutations of numbers from1toN).OutputPrint the number of vegetables, which are not worse than any other vegetable.Example Input 13\r\n1 1 1 1\r\n2 2 2 2\r\n3 3 3 3Example Output 11Example Input 210\r\n8 9 9 2\r\n3 7 2 4\r\n5 5 10 10\r\n9 3 5 9\r\n4 6 8 6\r\n2 8 1 7\r\n1 2 6 1\r\n7 4 7 5\r\n6 1 3 8\r\n10 10 4 3Example Output 25",
