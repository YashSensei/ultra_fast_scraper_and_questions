  "text": "Surely you know someone who thinks he is very clever. You decide to\r\nlet him\r\ndown with the following problem:\"Can you tell me what the syntax for a set is?\", you ask him.\"Sure!\", he replies, \"a set encloses a\r\npossibly empty list\r\nof elements within two curly braces. Each element is either another set\r\nor a letter of\r\nthe given alphabet. Elements in a list are separated by a comma.\"\"So if I give you a word, can you tell me if it is a\r\nsyntactically\r\ncorrect\r\nrepresentation of a set?\"\"Of course, any fool can do it!\" is his answer.Now you got him! You present him with the following grammar, defining\r\nformally the syntax for a set (which was described informally by him):Set          ::= \"{\" Elementlist \"}\"\r\nElementlist  ::= <empty> | List\r\nList         ::= Element | Element \",\" List\r\nElement      ::= Atom | Set\r\nAtom         ::= \"{\" | \"}\" | \",\"<empty> stands for the empty word, i.e. the list in a set can be empty.Soon he realizes that this task is much harder than he has thought,\r\nsince the alphabet consists of the characters\r\nwhich are also used for the syntax of the set. So he claims that it is\r\nnot possible to decide efficiently if a word\r\nconsisting of\"{\",\"}\"and\",\"is a syntactically correct\r\nrepresentation of a set or not.To disprove him, you need to write an efficient program that will\r\ndecide this\r\nproblem.Input SpecificationThe first line of the input file contains a number representing the\r\nnumber of lines to follow.Each line consists of a word, for which your\r\nprogram has to decide\r\nif it is a syntactically correct representation of a set.\r\nYou may assume that each word consists of between1and200characters\r\nfrom the set {\"{\", \"}\", \",\"}.Output SpecificationOutput for each test case whether the word is a set or not.\r\nAdhere to the format shown in the sample output.Sample Input4\r\n{}\r\n{{}}\r\n{{}},{,}}\r\n{,,}Sample OutputWord #1: Set\r\nWord #2: Set\r\nWord #3: Set\r\nWord #4: No Set",
