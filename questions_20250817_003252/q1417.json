At first John has\r\nto eat several M&Ms of the same color. Then his opponent has to make a turn.\r\nAnd so on. Please note that each player has to eat at least one M&M\r\nduring his turn. If John (or his brother) will eat the last M&M from the\r\nbox he will be considered as a loser and he will have to buy a new candy box.Both of players are using optimal game strategy. John starts first always.\r\nYou will be given information about M&Ms and your task is to determine a\r\nwinner of such a beautiful game.InputThe first line of input will contain a single integer T – the number of\r\ntest cases. Next T pairs of lines will describe tests in a following format.\r\nThe first line of each test will contain an integer N –\r\nthe number of different M&M colors in a box. Next line will contain N integers Ai,\r\nseparated by spaces – number of M&Ms of i-th color.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 474,1 ≤ N ≤ 47,1 ≤ Ai ≤ 4747OutputOutput T lines each of them containing information about game winner.\r\nPrint “John” if John will win the game or “Brother” in other case.SampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n3 5 1\r\n1\r\n1Output:John\r\nBrother",
