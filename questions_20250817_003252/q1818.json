  "text": "The Antique Comedians of Malidinesia play an interesting comedy\r\nwhere many animals occur. Because they want their plays to be as true as\r\npossible, a specialist studies the behaviour of various animals.\r\nRecently, he is interested in a binary dynamic ecological\r\nsystem hares-foxes (SHF). As a part of this project, you are asked to design\r\nand implement intelligent automatic target evaluation simulator\r\n(IATES) for this system. The behaviour of the SHF follows so\r\ncalledstandard model, described by the following set of\r\ndifference equations.hy+1= a.hy- b.fyfy+1= c.fy+ d.hywhere hyresp. fyrepresent the difference of the\r\nnumber of hares resp. foxes in yearyand the reference count\r\ndetermined at the beginning of the experiment. The units of hyand fyare unknown. Therefore, hyand fyare to be treated as real numbers.\r\nYour task is to write a program to determine the long term evolution of SHF.InputThe input consists ofNcases (equal to about 5000). The first line of the input\r\ncontains only positive integerN. Then follow the cases.\r\nEach case consists of six real numbersa, b, c, d,\r\nh1998andf1998,\r\nwritten in this order on three lines, two numbers per line, separated\r\nby one or more spaces. The numbers are given in the classical format,\r\ni.e. optional sign, sequence of digits, optional dot and optional\r\nsequence of digits. The text form of a number\r\ndoes not exceed 10 characters. Each case is followed by one empty line.OutputFor each case, print one of the following sentences:'Ecological balance will develop.' -\r\nif after sufficiently long time the population of both hares and foxes \r\napproaches the reference count with an arbitrary a priori given\r\nprecision, i.e.lim hy=0andlim\r\nfy=0.'Hares will die out while foxes will overgrow.' -\r\nif after sufficiently long time the population of hares resp. foxes \r\nfalls under resp. exceeds any a priori given threshold, i.e.lim hy=-infinityandlim fy=+infinity.'Hares will overgrow while foxes will die out.' -\r\nif after sufficiently long time the population of foxes resp. hares\r\nfalls under resp. exceeds any a priori given threshold, i.e.lim hy=+infinityandlim fy=-infinity.'Both hares and foxes will die out.' -\r\nif after sufficiently long time the population of both hares and foxes\r\nfalls under any a priori given threshold, i.e.lim hy=-infinityandlim fy=-infinity.'Both hares and foxes will overgrow.' -\r\nif after sufficiently long time the population of both hares and foxes\r\nexceeds any a priori given threshold, i.e.lim hy=+infinityandlim fy=+infinity.'Chaos will develop.' - if none of the above mentioned \r\ndescription fits.ExampleSample input:\r\n\r\n2\r\n2 0.5\r\n0.5 0.6\r\n2 3\r\n\r\n0.1 1 \r\n2 0.1\r\n1 1\r\n\r\nSample output:\r\n\r\nBoth hares and foxes will overgrow.\r\nHares will die out while foxes will overgrow.",
