  "text": "A civil engineer that has recently graduated from the Czech Technical University encountered\r\nan interesting problem and asked us for a help. The problem is more of economical than\r\nengineering nature. The engineer needs to connect several buildings with an infrastructure.\r\nUnfortunately, the investor is not the owner of all the land between these places. Therefore,\r\nsome properties have to be bought first.The land is divided into a regular \"grid\" of hexagonal parcels, each of them forms an independent\r\nunit and has the same value. Some of the parcels belong to the investor. These parcels form\r\nfour connected areas, each containing one building to be connected with the others. Your task\r\nis to find the minimal number of parcels that must be acquired to connect the four given areas.The whole land also has a hexagonal shape with six sides, each consisting of exactly H parcels.\r\nThe above picture shows a land with H = 4, parcels with letters represent the four areas to\r\nbe connected. In this case, it is necessary to buy four additional parcels. One of the possible\r\nsolutions is marked by crosses.InputThe input contains several scenarios. Each scenario begins with an integer number H, which\r\nspecifies the size of the land, 2 ≤ H ≤ 20. Then there are 2H - 1 lines representing individual\r\n\"rows\" of the land (always oriented as in the picture). The lines contain one non-space character\r\nfor each parcel. It means the first line will contain H characters, the second line H +1, and\r\nso on. The longest line will be the middle one, with 2H - 1 characters. Then the \"length\"\r\ndescends and the last line contains H parcels, again.The character representing a parcel will be either a dot (\".\") for the land that is not owned by\r\nthe investor, or one of the uppercase letters \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", or \"D\". The areas of parcels occupied\r\nby the same letter will always be connected. It means that between any two parcels in the same\r\narea, there exists a path leading only through that area.Beside the characters representing parcels, the lines may contain any number of spaces at any\r\npositions to improve \"human readability\" of the input. There is always at least one space\r\nbetween two letters (or the dots). After the land description, there will be one empty line and\r\nthen the next scenario begins. The last scenario is followed by a line containing zero.OutputFor each scenario, output one line with the sentence \"You have to buy P parcels.\", where\r\nP is the minimal number of parcels that must be acquired to make all four areas connected\r\ntogether.Areas are considered connected, if it is possible to find a path between them that leads only\r\nthrough parcels that have been bought.ExampleInput:4\r\n   B . .
