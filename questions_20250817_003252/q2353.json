  "text": "You are given a sequence H[1], H[2] ... H[N] representing the initial heights of N pieces of land and an integer K. It costs C[i] Rupees to elevate each of H[i], H[i+1] ... H[i+K-1] by E[i]; if i+K > N, it will just elevate all the pieces of land from A[i] to A[N] - Let us call this anoperation. The following constraints must be satisfied:For each i, theoperationcan be performed at most once.The sum of the costs of all the operations performed must be ≤ Budget.You have to calculate the maximum height V such that each plot's elevation is at least V before you exhaust the budget.InputThe first line of input contains 3 integers N, Budget and K.The next N lines consists of 3 integers H[i], E[i] and C[i].OutputOutput a single integer V such that all the plots have at least height V.Constraints1 ≤ K ≤ 111 ≤ N ≤ 1000 ≤ Budget, H[i], E[i], C[i] ≤ 1000000ExampleInput:4 20 1\r\n1 3 5\r\n1 7 3\r\n4 6 9\r\n3 5 13Output:3ExplanationYou can raise the level of the (unit) segments 1, 2 and 3, yielding a sequence of final heights 4, 8, 10 and 3. The minimum height among these is 3.",
