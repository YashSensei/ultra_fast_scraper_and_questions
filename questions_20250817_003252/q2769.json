  "text": "Topuch is the name of the brand new bubble tea shop just opened on your street. Just for a bubble tea lover like you :3Touch and Top, the owners of the shop, think that the tea that comes after and have less sweetness than the previous one is unique. So they would consider the pair of tea that is unique as having the uniqueness value of 1. You've just finished reading the shop description and suddenly, a cute girl in pink come up to you and ask you if you can calculate the uniqueness of the range of the tea sequence for her. You have to help help her... :3The uniqueness in rangeL...Ris defined by the number of the pair of(i, j) L ≤ i ≤ j ≤ Rthat the sweetness of tea atiis higher than the one atj.InputThe first line contains a single numberNdenoting the size of the tea sequence.(1 ≤ N ≤ 5000)The second line containsNnumbers;Aidenoting the sweetness of each tea.(1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1e9) (1 ≤ i ≤ N)The third line contains a single numberMdenoting the number of question the girl want to ask you.(1 ≤ M ≤ 1e6)The nextMlines each contain two numbers;L Rmeaning that the question asks about the sum of uniqueness of the all tea that is in range indexLtoR.(1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N)OutputMlines each contain a single number;Bjdenoting the answer for the questionj.ExampleInput:8 \r\n3 5 6 2 4 5 7 1\r\n5\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n2 5\r\n1 8\r\n4 7Output:0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n13\r\n0",
