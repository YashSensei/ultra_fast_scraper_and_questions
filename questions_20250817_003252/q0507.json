  "text": "Assume that each '0' or '1' in the array represents a point on a plane and the distance\r\nbetween each pair of neighbouring\r\npoints row wise or column wise is unity. Assume further that every\r\nneighbouring pair of1's,\r\nrow wise, column wise or diagonally is connected by a line segment. Two line segments emerging\r\nfrom a point, either join together to\r\nform a longer line segment or form an angle of45o,90oor135o, thus forming right-angled isosceles triangles. The\r\nexistence of hidden right-angled isosceles triangles in an array is illustrated\r\nin the figure below.InputInput consists of multiple test cases.For each test case the first line gives\r\nthree integers: the case numberk, the number of rowsmand the number of\r\ncolumnsnof the given array. A space appears between two\r\nneighbouring integers.Each of the nextmlines gives a string\r\nof0's and1's of lengthn; thei-th line gives thei-th row of the array.Input terminates with a value zero for case numberk.OutputFor each test case, display output in\r\none line. The line contains the case numberkand the area of the largest\r\nright-angled isosceles triangle hidden in the array. The area is a real number\r\nwith one digit after the decimal point. If a triangle does\r\nnot exist then output '0.0' as the area.Sample Input1 3 3\r\n101\r\n100\r\n101\r\n2 4 6\r\n001001\r\n010101\r\n111111\r\n000001\r\n0Sample Output1 0.0\r\n2 4.0Kanpur-Kolkata 2004-2005",
