  "text": "Ada the Ladybug has sequence of different vegetables (for simplicity represented by numbers). She has a few interesting questions of following form: Choose some continuous subsequence of vegetables, then assign each kind of vegetable a distinct positive number. She wants to assign them in a way that the sum (of assigned numbers) over all vegetables will be as low as possible.InputThe first line contains two integers1 ≤ N, Q ≤     2×105, the number of vegetables and number of questions.Next line containsNintegers1 ≤ Ai≤     109, the kinds of vegetables.NextQlines contains two integers1 ≤ I ≤ J ≤ N, the left and right indices of Ada's questions.OutputFor each question answer the minimal possible sum.Example Input 110 5\r\n1 1 3 2 4 1 3 1 1 4\r\n1 3\r\n1 10\r\n5 10\r\n3 5\r\n5 8Example Output 14\r\n19\r\n10\r\n6\r\n7Example IO explanationAssign 1 to 1 and 2 to 3Assign 1 to 1, 2 to 4, 3 to 3 and 4 to 2 (swapping 4 and 3 would work too)Assign 1 to 1 and 2 to 4 and 3 to 3Assign 1 to 4, 2 to 3 and 3 to 4 (but any permutation would do)Assign 1 to 1 and 2 to 4 and 3 to 3",
