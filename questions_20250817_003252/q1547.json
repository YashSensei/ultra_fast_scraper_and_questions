  "text": "You are given a sequence consisting of integersa1, a2, a3… an. Any elementaiis calledgoodif there exists another elementajin the sequence (i ≠ j) such thatajis anon-negative integral powerofai. In other wordsaiis calledgoodif there exists an elementajwherei ≠ jandaj=aikfor some integerk ≥ 0.For example, consider the following sequence:[2, 4, 4, 6, 3, 8]. This sequence contains3good elements. The1st,2ndand3rdelements are good.1st element “2” is good because there exists “4” and “8” in the different positions of the sequence which are non-negative power of “2” (22= 4,23= 8). 2nd element “4” is good because there exists another “4” in a different position of the sequence which is a non-negative power of “4” (41= 4). Same applies for the 3rd element.Given the sequence, now you have to find outtotal number of good elementsin the sequence.InputThe first line contains an integertdenoting the number of test cases.For every test case the first line contains the integernthe length of the given sequence. The second line contains the sequence of integersa[1], a[2], a[3] … a[n].Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 101 ≤ n ≤ 1041 ≤ ai≤ 106OutputFor each test case print the case number followed by the result in a single line according to the following format \"Case X: R\" (without quotes), whereXdenotes the case number andRdenotes the result. See the sample for further clarification.ExampleInput:3\r\n6\r\n2 4 4 6 3 8\r\n2\r\n1 2\r\n2\r\n10 100Output:Case 1: 3\r\nCase 2: 1\r\nCase 3: 1[ This problem originally contributed byHafiz Al Masud Ovi]",
