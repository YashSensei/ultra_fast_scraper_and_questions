  "text": "Given a positive integerN(1 ≤N≤ 10000) and some digits, find the smallest positive multiple ofNwhose decimal notation does not contain any of the given digits.InputEach test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integersNandmseparated by a single space. The second line containsmdigits separated by spaces. Input terminates by EOF.OutputFor each test case output its case number (starting from 1) and the answer in a single line, or \"-1\" (without quotes) if the answer doesn't exist.ExampleInput:2345 3\r\n7 8 9\r\n100 1\r\n0Output:Case 1: 2345\r\nCase 2: -1",
