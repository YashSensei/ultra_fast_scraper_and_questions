  "text": "f(n) and g(n) are two functions defined as following :f(n) =∏(pi2ei+1+1), where piis prime factor of n and eiis highest power of piin n.g(n) =Σ(n / gcd(n, i)); 1 ≤ i  ≤ nFor a given value of n, you have to compute [f(n) / g(n)] % 1000000007.InputFirst line has T (≤ 10000), next T lines has 2 ≤ n ≤ 1012.Output[f(n) / g(n)] % 1000000007 for each test case.ExampleInput:224Output:33Warning:Test cases aren't random. Test files consist of large  primes, strong  pseudo primes, Carmichael numbers, squares of primes,  product of large  primes, worst possible test cases for fermat, miller rabin and other  primality testing algorithms.Note: You may try thetutorial version( same test files, 5s-100s time limit ).",
