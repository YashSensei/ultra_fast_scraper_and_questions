  "text": "As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug has a huge TODO-list. Sometimes she inserts a new job into her TODO-list and sometimes she is wondering whether there is a job (in her TODO-list), which she wants to do now. She doesn't require the whole job to be there, perhaps just a part of it.Can you create a program which would serve her? That means it either inserts a new job into her TODO-list or answers whether there exists a word (in her TODO-list) which is a substring of given word.InputThe first line of input containsQ, the number of queries.The nextQlines contains a number0 ≤ t  ≤ 1and nonempty strings. Iftis equal to0then it is insertion query, otherwise it is question query.sconsists of lowercase characters only.The sum of lengths of queries of both types doesn't exceed106(that means the total sum of lengths of strings will be at most2*106)OutputFor each query of type1, print eitherYES, if there is already a substring in the TODO-list andNOotherwise.Example Input12\r\n0 cat\r\n1 dogville\r\n0 dog\r\n1 dogville\r\n1 gooutwithcat\r\n1 gooutwithcrocodile\r\n1 fancyconcatenation\r\n0 crocodile\r\n1 lacoste\r\n1 gooutwithcrocodile\r\n1 catalanreferendum\r\n1 rocodileExample OutputNO\r\nYES\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nYES\r\nYES\r\nNO",
