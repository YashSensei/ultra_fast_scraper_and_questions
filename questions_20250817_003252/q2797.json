  "text": "You are given a set S = {1, 2, 3 ... n}. Your task is simple. You have to calculate the number of ways of selecting non empty subsets A and B such that A is not a subset of B and B is not a subset of A. Since answer can be large output the result mod 109+ 7.InputFirst line of input contains single integer t denoting number of test cases.Next t lines contain a single integer n.OutputFor each test case output answer to problem by taking mod with 109+ 7.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 1000001 ≤ n ≤ 1000000ExampleINPUT:2\r\n4\r\n8OUTPUT:110\r\n52670",
