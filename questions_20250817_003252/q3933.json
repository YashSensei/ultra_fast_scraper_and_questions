  "text": "Factorial numbers are getting big very soon, you'll have to compute the number of divisors of such highly composite numbers.InputThe first line contains an integerT, the number of test cases.\r\nOn the nextTlines, you will be given two integersNandM.OutputOutputTlines, one for each test case, with the number of divisors of the factorial ofN.\r\nSince the answer can get very big, output it moduloM.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 1000\r\n3 11\r\n4 5Output:2\r\n4\r\n3Constraints0 < T < 5432\r\n1 < N < 10^8\r\n1 < M < 10^9For N, M : uniform random input in the range.\r\nOne input file.InformationAs it is possible to solve DIVFACT2 with fast language and intermediate method, here is the hard edition.Warning :It could be very hard or impossible to solve this problem with slow languages.\r\nTime limit is approx Ã—4 my unoptimized C_time. Good luck and have fun ;-)  (Edit 2017-02-11 ; TL updated ; compiler changes)",
