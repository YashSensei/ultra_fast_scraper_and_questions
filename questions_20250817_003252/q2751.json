  "text": "Consider a two-dimensional plane. There areNpoles standing parallel to y-axis. The ith pole has heightHiand is between y = 0 and y = Hi and at positionXi. The gravity acts along negative y-axis and its value is10.Qprojectiles are launched from origin with the jth projectile launched at an angleAjand with speedSj. For each projectile, print the index of pole that the projectile hits.The poles in input are arranged in increasing order ofXi. If a projectile doesn't hit any pole, print -1. Indices of pole starts from 1. The angle is given in degrees and all other units follow SI.Constraints1 <=N<= 10^51 <=Q<= 10^51 <=Xi<= 10^91 <=Sj<= 10^91 <=Aj<= 891 <=Hi<= 100InputAll values in input are integers.The first line contains N.The next N lines containes two space separated integers Xi and Hi. The Xi's are in increasing order and unique.The next line contains Q.The next Q line contains two space separated integers Aj and Sj.OutputPrint Q lines each containing the pole index hit by the jth projectile. If a projectile doesn't hit any pole, then print -1.ExampleInput:4\r\n1 1\r\n2 3\r\n3 7\r\n6 3\r\n8\r\n10 34\r\n45 20\r\n50 12\r\n60 14\r\n70 65\r\n60 34000000\r\n85 12\r\n81 14Output:1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n-1\r\n3\r\n-1\r\n4",
