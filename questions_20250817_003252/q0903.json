  "text": "You are given a permutation of first N natural numbers on which you are to perform K operations of following type: given integers A and B, your task is to swap elements on positions A and B in permutation and then output permutation rank modulo 1000 000 007.Note:Difference from original task is that elements remain swapped after query.InputOn first line of standard input you are given two integers (2 ≤ N ≤ 50 000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 30 000), length of permutation and number of operations.On the next line there is permutation of first N natural numbers.In next K lines there are two integers A, B ( 1 ≤ A, B ≤ N ).OutputOutput permutation rank after applying each of K operations.ExampleInput:5 31 5 4 2 31 32 32 5Output:917790",
