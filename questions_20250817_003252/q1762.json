  "text": "Misael is a child that loves maths. This year he learned about operations with decimal numbers, simplifying fractions, maximum and minimum of a set.But Misael is not an ordinary child. He knows programming and he proposed a challenge: He will give you a list of numbers and you must calculate all common divisors for all numbers on that list. The task is simple, but Misael offers you something even more interesting. The size list is variable, he can add as well as remove numbers. However Misael doesn't like the prime divisors, so you should exclude those numbers from the list.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases, and each case consists of an integerN(1 ≤N≤ 100000): the number of operations to perform.Each operation can be one of 3 types:UPD ADD x: Updating the list by adding the elementxto the list.UPD REM x: Update the list by removing the elementxfrom the list.CON:  print common divisors to the entire list.The range of values ​​ofxis 1 ≤x≤ 10000. There can be more that one element with the given value on the list. When removing element, you only remove one element with the given value. It's guaranteed that at least one such element will exist.OutputFor each type operation CON print a line with non-prime common divisors listed in ascending order. If the list is empty, print -1.ExampleInput:1\r\n6\r\nUPD ADD 6\r\nCON\r\nUPD ADD 12\r\nCON\r\nUPD REM 6\r\nCONOutput:1 6\r\n1 6\r\n1 4 6 12",
