  "text": "There is a robot on the 2D plane. Robot initially standing on the position (0, 0). Robot can make a 4 different moves:Up (from (x, y) to (x, y + 1)) with probabilityU.Right (from (x, y) to (x + 1, y)) with probabilityR.Down (from (x, y) to (x, y - 1)) with probabilityD.Left (from (x, y) to (x - 1, y)) with probabilityL.After movingNtimes Robot gets points.Let x1be the smallest coordinate in X-axis, that Robot reached in some moment.Let x2be the largest coordinate in X-axis, that Robot reached in some moment.Let y1be the smallest coordinate in Y-axis, that Robot reached in some moment.Let y2be the largest coordinate in Y-axis, that Robot reached in some moment.Points achieved by Robot equals to x2- x1+ y2- y1.GivenN, U, R, D, L. Calculateexpected valueof points that Robot achieved afterNmoves.InputFirst line: One intergerN (1 ≤ N ≤ 200).Second line: Four real numbersU, R, D, L (U + R + D + L = 1, 0 ≤ U, R, D, L≤ 1) with maximum of 6 numbers after dot.OutputOne number: expected value of points achieved by Robot. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10-6.Example 1Input:2\r\n0.100000 0.200000 0.300000 0.400000Output:1.780000Example 2Input:3\r\n0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25Output:2.375000",
