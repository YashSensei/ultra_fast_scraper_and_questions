Find the number of zeroes in the digits of all the numbers in the range [a, b] inclusive.InputThe first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases.  For each test case you will be given two integers a and b (a ≤ b).OutputFor each test case print the required answer.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 10001 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 109ExampleInput:2\r\n1 10\r\n1 100Output:1\r\n11",
