  "text": "EnglishVietnameseEdward works as an engineer for Non-trivial Elevators: Engineering, Research and Construction (NEERC). His new task is to design a brand new elevator for a skyscraper with h ﬂoors. Edward has an idée fixe: he thinks that four buttons are enough to control the movement of the elevator. His last proposal suggests the following four buttons:Move a ﬂoors up.Move b ﬂoors up.Move c ﬂoors up.Return to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.Initially, the elevator is on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. A passenger uses the ﬁrst three buttons to reach the ﬂoor she needs. If a passenger tries to move a, b or c ﬂoors up and there is no such ﬂoor (she attempts to move higher than the h-th ﬂoor), the elevator doesn’t move. To prove his plan worthy, Edward wants to know how many ﬂoors are actually accessible from the ﬁrst ﬂoor via his elevator. Help him calculate this number.InputThe ﬁrst line of the input ﬁle contains one integer h — the height of the skyscraper (1 ≤ h ≤ 10^18). The second line contains three integers a, b and c — the parameters of the buttons (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 100000)OutputOutput one integer number — the number of ﬂoors that are reachable from the ﬁrst ﬂoor.ExampleInput 1:15\n4 7 9Output 1:9Input 2:500000\n160 96 111Output 2:498167Input 3:987654321987654321\n99995 99997 99999Output 3:987654319487854318",
