Well, his die is magical and can be transformed into an N-sided unbiased die with the push of a button.  Now BuggyD wants to learn more about his die, so he raises a question:What is the expected number of throws of his die while it hasNsides so that each number is rolled at least once?InputThe first line of the input contains an integert, the number of test cases.ttest cases follow.Each test case consists of a single line containing a single integerN(1 ≤N≤ 1000) - the number of sides on BuggyD's die.OutputFor each test case, print one line containing the expected number of times BuggyD needs to throw hisN-sided die so that each number appears at least once.  The expected number must be accurate to 2 decimal digits.ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n12Output:1.00\r\n37.24",
