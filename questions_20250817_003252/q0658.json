  "text": "The process of “breaking” an integer is defined as summing the squares of its digits. For example, the result of breaking the integer125is (12+22+52) =30. An integerNishappyif after “breaking” it repeatedly the result reaches 1. If the result never reaches 1 no matter how many times the “breaking” is repeated, then N is not a happy number.TASKWrite a program that given an integer N, determines whether it is a happy number or not.CONSTRAINTS2 ≤N≤ 2,147,483,647InputA single line containing a single integerN.OutputA single line containing a single integerTwhich is the number of times the process had to be done to determine that N is happy, or-1ifNis not happy.ExampleInput:19Output:41) 19  : 12+ 92= 82\r\n2) 82  : 82 + 22= 68\r\n3) 68  : 62+ 82= 100\r\n4) 100 : 12+ 02+ 02= 1The solution is 4 because we discovered that the integer 19 is happy after we repeated the process 4 times.Input:204Output:-1204 –>20–> 4 –> 16 –> 37 –> 58 –> 89 –> 145 –> 42 –>20–> 4 –> 16 –> 37 –> 58 –> 89 –> 145 ……204is not a happy number because after breaking it several times the results start repeating so we can deduce that if we continue breaking it, the result will never reach 1.Number of input files is32.Don't use pre-calculated values (Don't Cheat)!!!",
