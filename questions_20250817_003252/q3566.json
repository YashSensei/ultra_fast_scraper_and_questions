  "text": "Anjali and Nakul are good friends. They both had a quarrel recently while playing chess. Nakul wants to know the minimum number of moves a knight takes to reach from one square to another square of a chess board (8 × 8). Nakul is brilliant and he had already written a program to solve the problem. Nakul wants to know whether Anjali can do it. Anjali is very weak in programming. Help her to solve the problem.A knight can move in the shape of an \"L\" in a chessboard - two squares either forward, backward, left, or right and then one square to its left or right. A knight move is valid if it moves as mentioned above and it is within the boundary of the chessboard (8 × 8).InputThere are T test cases in total. The next T lines contain two strings (start and destination) separated by a space.The strings start and destination will only contain two characters -  First character is an alphabet between 'a' and 'h' (inclusive), Second  character is a digit between '1' and '8' (inclusive) - (Quotes just for  clarity).To know the knight moves more clearly refer to the above figure.OutputPrint the minimum number of moves a knight takes to reach from start to destination in a separate line.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 4096ExampleInput:3\r\na1 h8\r\na1 c2\r\nh8 c3Output:6\r\n1\r\n4",
