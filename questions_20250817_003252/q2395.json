  "text": "A chemical company has an unusual shortest path problem.\r\nThere are N depots (vertices) where chemicals can be stored.\r\nThere are M individual shipping methods (edges) connecting pairs\r\nof depots. Each individual shipping method has a cost. In\r\nthe usual problem, the company would need to find a way to route\r\na single shipment from the first depot (0) to the last (N - 1).\r\nThat's easy. The problem they have seems harder. They have to ship\r\ntwo chemicals from the first depot (0) to the last (N - 1). The chemicals\r\nare dangerous and cannot safely be placed together. The regulations say\r\nthe company cannot use the same shipping method for both chemicals.\r\nFurther, the company cannot place the two chemicals in same depot\r\n(for any length of time) without special storage handling --- available only at\r\nthe first and last depots.To begin, they need to know if it's possible to ship both\r\nchemicals under these constraints. Next, they need to find the\r\nleast cost of shipping both chemicals from first depot to the\r\nlast depot. In brief, they need two completely separate paths\r\n(from the first depot to the last) where the overall\r\ncost of both is minimal.Your program must simply determine the minimum cost or, if it's\r\nnot possible, conclusively state that the\r\nshipment cannot be made.The input will consist of multiple cases. The first line of\r\neach input will contain N and M where N is the number of depots\r\nand M is the number of individual shipping methods. You may assume\r\nthat N is less than 20 and that M is less than 200.The next M lines will contain three values, i, j, and v.\r\nEach line corresponds a single, unique shipping method. The values i\r\nand j are the indices of two depots, and v is the cost of\r\ngetting from i to j.Note that these shipping methods are directed. If something can\r\nbe shipped from i to j with cost 10, that says nothing about shipping\r\nfrom j to i. Also, there may be more than one way to ship between\r\nany pair of depots, and that may be important here.A line containing two zeroes signals the end of data and should not\r\nbe processed.SampleInput:2 1\r\n0 1 20\r\n2 3\r\n0 1 20\r\n0 1 20\r\n1 0 10\r\n4 6\r\n0 1 22\r\n1 3 11\r\n0 2 14\r\n2 3 26\r\n0 3 43\r\n0 3 58\r\n0 0Output:Instance #1: Not possible\r\nInstance #2: 40\r\nInstance #3: 73",
