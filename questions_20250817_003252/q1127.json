  "text": "The Bogus Corporation distributes salary to its employees in a weird\r\nmanner. The salary is distributed everyKdays,\r\nand instead of same salary for each day, the salary for the ithday is ai. An ambitious young manager, fresh\r\nfromInstitute of Mismanagement, observes that people usually prefer to\r\ntake leave towards the end of this period of K days, when the workload\r\nis higher. Instead of revising each of the ai's,\r\nthe manager comes up with a quick fix solution - he redefines\r\nthe new salary on the ithday as bi= ai+ 2ai-1+ 22ai-2+ 23ai-3+ ... + 2i-1a1. Baba, one of the employees, is in a dire financial crisis, and must\r\naccumulate at leastNrupees at the end\r\nof the forthcoming period. Being a lazy worker that he is, he is\r\ninterested in finding out if attending particular days would guarantee\r\nhimexactlyNrupees at the end of the period. Can you help Baba?InputFirst line contains a single integer integerT, the number of\r\ntest cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100). Each test case is described on\r\ntwo lines. First line contains two integers,NandK(1 ≤ N ≤ 263-1, 1 ≤ K ≤ 50) , the second line contains a space separated\r\nlist of K integers, theai's (1 ≤ ai≤ 1000).OutputFor each test case, output on a single line 1-based indices of the days\r\n(separated by a single space) he should attend to ensure a salary of\r\nexactly N rupees at the end of the period. The indices should be\r\nprinted in the sorted order. In case of multiple answers, output any\r\none of them. If there is no answer, print -1.ExampleInput:2\r\n9 3\r\n1 1 2\r\n10 2\r\n2 3Output:1 3\r\n-1",
