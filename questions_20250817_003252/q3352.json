  "text": "The digit-product of a positive integer is the product of the number's decimal digits. For example, the digit-product of 2612 is 2 · 6 · 1 · 2 = 24.The self-product of a number is the product of the number and its digit-product. For example, the self-product of 2612 is 2612 · 24 = 62688.Write a program that, given two positive integers A and B (1 ≤ A ≤ B < 1018), calculates the number of positive integers whose self-product is between A and B, inclusive.InputThe first line of input contains the integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20). The next T lines each contain a pair of integers A and B.OutputFor each test case, print a line with the number of positive integers whose self-product is between A and B.ExampleInput:3\r\n20 30\r\n145 192\r\n2224222 2224222Output:2\r\n4\r\n1For the second example, the self-products of the numbers 19, 24, 32, and 41 are 171, 192, 192 and 164, respectively.",
