  "text": "There's a line ofNnumbers where each number is a positive integer that is less than109. Every second, an alien comes down to the Earth and ask a certain problem. \"How many zeros are there after all the other digits when you multiply all the number in rangeLandR?\" Unfortunately, the alien don't know base 10 numbers. In fact, there are6species of alien in the UFO, the first species use base-1 number, second use base-2 and so on. (Yes, the first species do not exist, and therefore will not come down to the Earth).You are given a task to answer the aliens' questions in their numerical system for a day, which mean there're up to100,000questions to be answer.InputFirst line,N ≤ 100000which is mentioned aboveandQ ≤ 100000representing number of questions.Next line,Npositive integerson the line on earth, each not exceeding109.NextQlines,1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ Nrepresenting a range each alien mentioned, and2 ≤ S ≤ 6representing the alien species.OutputQ lines,each line is a number represent the answer for each alien.ExampleInput:5 32 3 6 5 1001 5 21 3 61 2 3Output:421",
