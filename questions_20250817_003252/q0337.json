  "text": "A scuba diver uses a special equipment for diving. He has a cylinder with two containers: one with oxygen and the other with nitrogen. Depending on the time he wants to stay under water and the depth of diving the scuba diver needs various amount of oxygen and nitrogen. The scuba diver has at his disposal a certain number of cylinders. Each cylinder can be described by its weight and the volume of gas it contains. In order to complete his task the scuba diver needs specific amount of oxygen and nitrogen. What is the minimal total weight of cylinders he has to take to complete the task?ExampleThe scuba diver has at his disposal 5 cylinders described below. Each description consists of: volume of oxygen, volume of nitrogen (both values are given in litres) and weight of the cylinder (given in decagrams):3 36 120\r\n10 25 129\r\n5 50 250\r\n1 45 130\r\n4 20 119If the scuba diver needs 5 litres of oxygen and 60 litres of nitrogen then he has to take two cylinders of total weight 249 (for example the first and the second ones or the fourth and the fifth ones).TaskWrite a program that for each test case:reads scuba diver's demand for oxygen and nitrogen, the number of accessible cylinders and their descriptions;computes the minimal total weight of cylinders the scuba diver needs to complete his task;outputs the result.Note:the given set of cylinders always allows to complete the given task.InputThe number of test casescis in the first line of input, thenctest cases follow separated by an empty line.In the first line of a test case there are two integerst,aseparated by a single space, 1 ≤t≤ 21 and 1 ≤a≤ 79. They denote volumes of oxygen and nitrogen respectively, needed to complete the task. The second line contains one integern, 1 ≤n≤ 1000, which is the number of accessible cylinders. The followingnlines contain descriptions of cylinders;i-th line contains three integersti,ai,wiseparated by single spaces, (1 ≤ti≤ 21, 1 ≤ai≤ 79, 1 ≤wi≤ 800). These are respectively: volume of oxygen and nitrogen in thei-th cylinder and the weight of this cylinder.OutputFor each test case your program should output one line with the minimal total weight of cylinders the scuba diver should take to complete the task.ExampleSample input:1\r\n5 60\r\n5\r\n3 36 120\r\n10 25 129\r\n5 50 250\r\n1 45 130\r\n4 20 119Sample output:249",
