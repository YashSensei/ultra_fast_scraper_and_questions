  "text": "Given two strings A and B. You have to find the length of the smallest substring of A, such that B is the subsequence of this substring.Formally speaking you have to find the length of smallest possible string S such that:S is the substring of A.B is the subsequence S.Note: Subsequence of an string S is obtained by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters from it. for example \"ah\" is the subsequence of \"aohol\".InputFirst line contains T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow, 2 lines for each test case, 1st contains A and 2nd contain B.|A| ≤ 20000, |B| ≤ 100OutputFor each test case print the answer in a new line. if no such substring exists print -1 instead.ExampleInput:2\r\naaddddcckhssdd\r\nacs\r\nghkkhllhjkhthkjjht\r\nhhOutput:10\r\n3",
