  "text": "Given an n×n grid of cells, a bacteria colony can colonize these cells. Their growth after every second is governed by the following rules:One new bacteria is born in cell (i, j) if and only if either one of its four neighboring cells or the cell (i, j) itself has a bacteria population more than or equal to the threshold value, k.Already living bacteria do not die.Given, the initial state of the n×n cell grid, you need to accurately estimate the time by when the total bacteria population reaches m.InputFirst line contains t, number of test cases.Each test case starts with n (side length of grid), k (growth threshold) and m (final population).Next n lines contain an n×n grid of integers, where ith row, jth column has an integer representing the number of bacteria present initially at cell (i, j).1< n ≤ 100, 0 < k ≤ 245, 0 < m ≤ 245.There are no more than n cells with initial population equal to or greater than k.OutputFor each test case print the number of seconds required for the total bacteria population to reach m. If m can never be reached print \"Not possible\" (quotes for clarity).ExampleInput:1\r\n3 5 15\r\n0 0 0\r\n0 3 0\r\n0 0 5Output:3",
