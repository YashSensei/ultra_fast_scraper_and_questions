  "text": "The L1distance of two d-dimensional points is the sum of\r\nabsolute values of their coordinate differences (i.e.\r\nΣi=1d|xi- yi| for two points x,y).  Given N points in\r\nthe plane you must find the farthest pair of points under the L1distance metric and output their distance.InputThe first line of the input is \"N d\" (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, 1 ≤\r\nd ≤ 6) signifying that there are N points in d-dimensional\r\nspace.  N lines then follow, where the ith line is a\r\nspace-separated list of d numbers, the coordinates of the ith point.\r\nAll given coordinates are integers that are at most 1000000 in\r\nabsolute value, and all given points are distinct.OutputYour output should consist of a single integer, the farthest distance\r\nbetween a pair of input points, followed by a newline.ExampleInput:3 2\r\n0 0\r\n-5 0\r\n1 1Output:7",
