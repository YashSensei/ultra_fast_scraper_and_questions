  "text": "We all know about the classical Fibonacci series, Fibonacci series is F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). For this question we call it a 2-Nacci series as a new element is calculated as the sum of the last 2 terms of the series. For Fibonacci we assume F(0)=0 and F(1)=1. We define as new series N-Nacci where F(n) is the sum of the last n terms and here we assume that F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=2 ... F(n-1) = (n-1). Your task is to calculate the last K digits of the Lth term of the N-Nacci series (no leading zeros needed).Constraints2 ≤ N ≤ 30K ≤ 8L ≤ 1000000000InputThe first line of the input denotes the number of test cases t (at most 10). Each line denotes a test case consisting of N, K, L.OutputFor each test case print the last K digits of the Lth term of the N-Nacci series.ExampleInput:4\r\n2 1 5\r\n3 6 12\r\n4 1 10\r\n4 2 10Output:5\r\n778\r\n6\r\n16",
