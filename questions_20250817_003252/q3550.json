  "text": "Erdős Pál and John Selfridge classified prime numbers in this way: for a primep, if the largest prime factor ofp - 1is2or3, thenpis in class one.  Otherwise,pis in classc + 1wherecis the largest of the classes of the prime factors ofp - 1. We putp = 2in class one.  For example,p = 89is in class three, becausep - 1 = 23× 11and here2is in class one, but11is in class two (because11 - 1 = 2 × 5and here2and5are in class one). Your task is to count the number of primes in each class up to class thirteen for a given (closed) interval.InputThe first line contains the number of test casesT, whereT ≤ 1000. Each of the followingTlines contains two integersa, bwhere0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 50000000. There are 4 input sets.OutputOutput the case number, followed by the distribution of the primes in each class up to class13in the (closed) interval[a, b]. See the sample input/output for the correct format!ExampleInput:3\r\n2 100\r\n23 23\r\n0 50000000Output:Case 1:\r\nThere are 10 primes in class 1.\r\nThere are 9 primes in class 2.\r\nThere are 5 primes in class 3.\r\nThere are 1 primes in class 4.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 5.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 6.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 7.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 8.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 9.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 10.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 11.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 12.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 13.\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 1.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 2.\r\nThere are 1 primes in class 3.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 4.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 5.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 6.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 7.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 8.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 9.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 10.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 11.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 12.\r\nThere are 0 primes in class 13.\r\n\r\nCase 3:\r\nThere are 54 primes in class 1.\r\nThere are 14196 primes in class 2.\r\nThere are 364182 primes in class 3.\r\nThere are 1029984 primes in class 4.\r\nThere are 939493 primes in class 5.\r\nThere are 458831 primes in class 6.\r\nThere are 150902 primes in class 7.\r\nThere are 34878 primes in class 8.\r\nThere are 7085 primes in class 9.\r\nThere are 1310 primes in class 10.\r\nThere are 203 primes in class 11.\r\nThere are 15 primes in class 12.\r\nThere are 1 primes in class 13.Warning: A naive algorithm will probably solve only the first input set.",
