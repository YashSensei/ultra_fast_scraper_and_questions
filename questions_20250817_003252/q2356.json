  "text": "For a sequence of N integers, A1, A2... ANWe can calculate the stability factor P, asP = sum of all (abs(Ai- Ai-1) × C[i]) where 2 ≤ i ≤ NC[i] is the cost of putting a number at position iYour task is find the minimum P for the given N numbers considering all the different permutations of them.InputFirst line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10) which denotes the total number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines.The first line contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 15). The second line contains a space separated list of N integers (<150) which denote the given set of numbers.The third line contains a space separated list of N integers. The ith integer on this line denotes the value for C[i] (1 ≤ C[i] < 150)OutputFor each test case, print the minimum possible value of P considering all permutations of the given numbers.ExampleInput:1\r\n5\r\n1 8 3 6 5\r\n1 2 3 4 5Output24One of the possible permutation of given numbers which has p = 24 is 1, 3, 5, 6, 8",
