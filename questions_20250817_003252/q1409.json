  "text": "EnglishVietnameseA bee larva living in a hexagonal cell of a large honey comb decides to creep\r\nfor a walk. In each “step” the larva may move into any of the six adjacent cells\r\nand after n steps, it is to end up in its original cell.Your program has to compute, for a given n, the number of different such larva walks.InputThe ﬁrst line contains an integer giving the number of test cases to follow.\r\nEach case consists of one line containing an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 14.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing the number of walks. Under the\r\nassumption 1 ≤ n ≤ 14, the answer will be less than 231.Input:2\r\n2\r\n4Output:6\r\n90",
