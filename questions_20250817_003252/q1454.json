The sum of two or more vectors is a vector whose coordinates are the sums of the corresponding coordinates of all the vectors in the sum. e.g. (1, 2) + (3, 4) + (5, 6) = (1 + 3 + 5, 2 + 4 + 6) = (9, 12) Weight of a vector (x, y) is defined as x * x + y * y. You are given N vectors on a plain.Your task is to write a program that will determine a subset of those vectors so the weight of the sum of all vectors in that subset is maximal.Note: Use 64-bit integers (int64 in pascal or long long in c)InputIn the first line of the input file is an integer N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 30,000, the number of vectors.The following N lines contain descriptions for each of the vectors. A description is made of two integers X and Y, separated by a single blank, -30,000 ≤ X, Y ≤ 30,000.None of the given vectors will be (0, 0)OutputIn the first and only line of the output file you have to write the weight of the maximum sum.ExampleInput:5\r\n5 -8\r\n-4 2\r\n4 -2\r\n2 1\r\n-6 4Output:202Input:4\r\n1 4\r\n-1 -1\r\n1 -1\r\n-1 4Output:64Input:9\r\n0 1\r\n6 8\r\n0 -1\r\n0 6\r\n-1 1\r\n-1 2\r\n5 -4\r\n1 0\r\n6 -5Output:360",
