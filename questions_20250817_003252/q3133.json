  "text": "Mo and Larry have devised a way of encrypting messages. They first decide secretly on the number of\r\ncolumns and write the message (letters only) down the columns, padding with extra random letters so\r\nas to make a rectangular array of letters. For example, if the message is “There’s no place like home on\r\na snowy night” and there are five columns, Mo would write downt o i o y\r\nh p k n n\r\ne l e a i\r\nr a h s g\r\ne c o n h\r\ns e m o t\r\nn l e w xNote that Mo includes only letters and writes them all in lower case. In this example, Mo used the\r\ncharacter ‘x’ to pad the message out to make a rectangle, although he could have used any letter.\r\nMo then sends the message to Larry by writing the letters in each row, alternating left-to-right and\r\nright-to-left. So, the above would be encrypted astoioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewxYour job is to recover for Larry the original message (along with any extra padding letters) from the\r\nencrypted one.InputThere will be multiple input sets. Input for each set will consist of two lines. The first line will contain\r\nan integer in the range 2...20 indicating the number of columns used. The next line is a string of up\r\nto 200 lower case letters. The last input set is followed by a line containing a single 0, indicating end of\r\ninput.OutputEach input set should generate one line of output, giving the original plaintext message, with no spaces.ExampleInput:5\r\ntoioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx\r\n3\r\nttyohhieneesiaabss\r\n0Output:theresnoplacelikehomeonasnowynightx\r\nthisistheeasyoneab",
