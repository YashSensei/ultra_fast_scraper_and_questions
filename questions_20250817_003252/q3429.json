All given points are distinct, and all coordinates fit into a 32-bit signed integer.OutputYour output should consist of a single number, the number of distinct axis-parallel rectangles whose four vertices all lie inS, followed by a newline.ExampleInput:6\r\n-1 0\r\n-1 1\r\n0 0\r\n0 1\r\n1 0\r\n1 1Output:3",
