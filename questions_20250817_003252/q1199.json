  "text": "Anil is the best coder in his class. He is in love with his classmate Gowthami. One day he proposes her. She wants him to prove that his love is actually true. So, she poses the following problem:There is an array of sizen. Initially all the elements are zero. Now there will be two types of operations:Update the array.Query the array.In case of update, you will be given a range [l,r]. To the kth element in this range (l and r inclusive), you need toadd kth Fibonacci number.In case of query, you will be given a range [l,r], for which you need to find the sum of all elements in the range (including l and r).Anil hopes you can help him in this regard.InputThe first line containsn (1 ≤ n ≤ 106)andq (1 ≤ q ≤ 5×104), the number of operations to be performed. The nextqlines contain 3 space separated integers. If the first integer is0, then it's an update operation. If it is1, then it's a query operation. The next two integers specifylandr.(1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n)OutputFor each query print one integer per line specifying the sum in the corresponding range. Since the sum can be very large, outputAnswer modulo 109+ 7.ExampleInput:5 6\r\n0 1 5\r\n0 2 4\r\n0 1 3\r\n1 2 4\r\n1 1 5\r\n1 4 5Output:13\r\n20\r\n10ExplanationAfter the first update the array looks as follows: 1 1 2 3 5After 2nd update: 1 2 3 5 5After 3rd update: 2 3 5 5 5Hence from the above array, we have the outputs for the queries.Note: Fibonacci Series starts as 1, 1, 2, 3, ...",
