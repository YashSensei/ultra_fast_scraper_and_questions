  "text": "HOD of CSE Dept. of MMMEC, asked the students to form the groups for their final year project. He said that there will be t students per team and there will be at least 4 boys and at least 1 girl per group.A curious student Rajesh want to know the total number of ways by which the groups can be made. Because he is busy in forming his group so you, write a program to find the total ways and help him.InputFirst line contains an integer n which itself indicates number of test cases.Each test case comprises of three space separated integers \"B G t\". Where B denotes number of boys, G denotes number of girls in the class, and t denotes number of students in a group.Constraints1 ≤ n ≤ 204 ≤ B ≤ 301 ≤ G ≤ 305 ≤ t ≤ B + GOutputFor each test case print total number of ways per line.ExampleInput:2\r\n4 1 5\r\n30 30 20Output:1\r\n4191318957352590",
