  "text": "Solar cycle predictions are used by various agencies and many industry groups.\r\n The solar cycle is important for determining the lifetime of satellites in low-Earth orbit,\r\n as the drag on the satellites correlates with the solar cycle [...].(NOAA)(Solar Cycle)Sunspot Number Progression : Observed data through May 2008 ; Dec 2012 ; Nov 2014The goal of the problem is to propose a perfect prediction center, with weak constraints.Let us consider periodic functions fromZtoR.deff(x):return[4,-6,7][x%3]# (with Python notations)# 4, -6, 7, 4, -6, 7, 4, -6, 7, 4, -6, 7, 4, -6, 7, ...For example,fis a 3-periodic function, withf(0) =f(3) =f(6) =f(9) = 4. \r\nWith a simplified notation we will denote f as [4, -6, 7].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two periodic functions (with integral period), the quotient of periods will be rational, in that case it can be shown that the sum of the functions is also a periodic function. Thus, the set of all such functions is a vector space overR.For that problem, we consider a function that is the sum of several periodic functions all with as period an integerNat maximum. You will be given some starting values, you'll have to find new ones.InputThe first line contains an integerT, the number of test cases, then each case will be given on three lines.\r\nOn the first line, you will be given an integerN.\r\nOn the second line, you will be given integersy: the first (0-indexed)N×Nvalues of a periodic functionfthat is sum of periodic functions all with as period an integerNat maximum.\r\nOn the third line, you will be givenN×Nintegersx.OutputPrintf(x)for all requiredx. See sample for details.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n5 7 5 7\r\n6 7 8 9\r\n3\r\n15 3 17 2 16 4 15 3 17\r\n10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 10000000 100000000 1000000000Output:5 7 5 7\r\n16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16ExplanationTest case 1: for examplefcan be seen as the sum of two periodic functions : [5] + [0, 2] (with simplified notations)\r\nWe know thatf(0)=5 andf(1)=7, we can deduce thatf(6)=5, and so on...Test case 2: for examplefcan be seen as the sum of three periodic functions : [10] + [5, -8] + [0, 1, 2] (with simplified notations). In that casef(10) = [10][10%1] + [5, -8][10%2] + [0, 1, 2][10%3] = 10 + 5 + 1 = 16, and so on.Constraints0 < T < 1024\r\n1 < N < 14 : uniform distribution\r\nabs(y) < 10^9\r\n0 < x < 10^9InformationConstraints allow easy coding with various languages. (Edited 2017-02-11 ; with compiler changes)\r\nThere's two input files, a small one and a bigger.\r\nMy PY3.4 code ended in 0.02+0.28 = 0.30s. My C code in 0.01s.\r\nIf you find the constraints too weak, please considerPERIOD3.Have fun ;-)",
