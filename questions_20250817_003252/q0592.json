  "text": "Let Lx denote the level of a node x in a rooted tree. Lx is 1 if x is the root, otherwise Lx = 1 + Ly, where y is the parent of x in the rooted tree.You need to calculate the sum Lx ^ K for all nodes x in the tree.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains N and K, where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The following N - 1 lines contain two integers ai and bi, indicating an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. There is a blank line after each test case.OutputOutput N lines for each test case. The i-th line should contain the required sum if the tree is rooted at node i. Output all values modulo 1000000007. Output a blank line after each test case.ExampleSample Input:2\r\n3 2\r\n0 1\r\n1 2\r\n\r\n3 3\r\n0 1\r\n0 2Sample Output:14\r\n9\r\n14\r\n\r\n17\r\n36\r\n36Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ N ≤ 200001 ≤ K ≤ 200 ≤ ai, bi < N",
