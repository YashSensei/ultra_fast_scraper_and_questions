  "text": "Bablu is very fond of Series and Sequences...After studying Fibonacci Series in Class IX, he was impressed and he designed his own sequence as follows...a[0] = a[1] = 0For n > 1, a[n] = a[n - 1] + f(n), where f(n) is smallest prime factor of n.He is also very fond of programming and thus made a small program to find a[n], but since he is in Class IX, he is not very good at programming. So, he asks you for help. Your task is to find a[n] for the above sequence....InputYour code will be checked for multiple test cases.First line of Input contains T (â‰¤ 100), the number of test cases.Next T lines contain a single number N. (1 < N < 107).OutputSingle line containing a[n] i.e. nth number of the sequence for each test case.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4Output:2\r\n5\r\n7",
