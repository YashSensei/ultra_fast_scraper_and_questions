  "text": "You are given two arrays each of length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000) which are initially filled with zeros. You have to apply M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100000) queries of three kind:0 arr left right :calculate and output sum of elements from left to right in array arr (arr = 0 -- first array, arr = 1 -- second array);1 arr idx newValue :change value of element at index idx of array arr on newValue;2 left right :swap range of elements of two arrays from left to right ( for i = left to right do swap(a[i], b[i]) );InputThe first line of input contains two integers - N, M. The folowing M lines contains information about queries.On each query - one line:First integer number cmd contains 0, 1 or 2 (type of query described above).if cmd equals0, then following 3 integers arr, left, right - 0 ≤ arr ≤ 1, 0 ≤ left ≤ right ≤ N - 1.if cmd equals1, then following 3 integers arr, idx, newValue - 0 ≤ arr ≤ 1, 0 ≤ idx ≤ N - 1, -10000 ≤ newValue ≤ 10000.if cmd equals2, then following 2 integers left, right - 0 ≤ left ≤ right ≤ N - 1.OutputOn each query with cmd equals 0 you should output corresponding value described above.ExampleInput:5 101 0 0 11 1 4 20 0 0 40 1 0 42 0 00 0 0 40 1 0 42 0 40 0 0 40 1 0 4Output:120330",
