  "text": "Alias is an assumed or additional name that constitutes a distinctive designation of a person. Consider a set of n  persons and assume that each person has k  distinct aliases. A person is identified using any one of its k  aliases. The nk  (= n×k)  distinct aliases are identified using integers 1, 2 ... nk. Integers 1, 2 ... n  represent the first aliases of all n  persons in an arbitrary order. In general, integers (j - 1)×n + 1,(j - 1)×n + 2 ... (j - 1)×n + n  represent the jth  alias of all n persons in an arbitrary order, for j = 1, 2 ... k. Persons in the set are totally ordered with respect to a quality characteristic Q  associated with each person. Let Q(r)  be the value of Q  for a person identified by one of its alias r.Given a sufficient number, say m , of inequalities of the type: Q(r) > Q(s) , you are required to write a program to sort all persons in descending order and recognize all aliases of each person in the set.As a simple illustration consider distinct total marks scored by three students in an examination. Each student is identified by any one of three distinct aliases in the Name: {first-name middle-name last-name}. Let integers 1, 2, 3 represent the first names, 4, 5, 6 represent the middle names and 7, 8, 9 represent the last names in an arbitrary order. Let Q(r) be the total marks of student r, r being an alias. Given the following inequalities: Q(6) > Q(1), Q(9) > Q(4), Q(5) > Q(8), Q(2) > Q(9), Q(7) > Q(3), Q(9) > Q(3) , one can conclude that the names of students appearing in descending order of total marks are {2 6 7}, {1 5 9} and {3 4 8}.InputThe input may contain multiple test cases.For each test case the first input line gives the parameters n , k and m.The second line contains m inequalities represented by 2×m integers. An integer r occurring in an odd numbered position in the line and the integer s occurring in the next even numbered position, represent the inequality Q(r) > Q(s).Assume that nk is less than 100 and each integer in the second input line is of two digits, including a non-significant 0 when required.The input terminates with a line containing 0 as input.OutputFor each test case print n lines giving k aliases of each person in a line; a line contains aliases in increasing order. Arrange persons in descending order of the quality characteristic Q. As in input, each integer in output is of two digits, including a non-significant 0 when required.A blank line appears after the last output line of a test case.ExampleSample Input3 3 6\r\n06 01 09 04 05 08 02 09 07 03 09 03\r\n2 4 2\r\n03 08 02 05\r\n0Sample Output02 06 07\r\n01 05 09\r\n03 04 08\r\n\r\n02 03 06 07\r\n01 04 05 08",
