  "text": "There's a 5×N rectangular corridor in the hall's dojo, one place is already taken by a magic hanjō (1×1 square).\r\nYou have to put tatamis (1×2 rectangle) in order to cover exactly the rest of the corridor.\r\nSometimes it's possible, sometimes not!InputThe input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.\r\nIn each of the next T lines there are an integer N the H-length of the corridor,\r\nand I, J the coordinates of the magic hanjō. See sample input for details format.OutputFor each test case, print the number of possibility to do the job, modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n1 C 1\r\n3 B 2\r\n5 A 1Output:1\r\n8\r\n192Constraints1 <= T <= 40 0001 <= N <= 20 000A <= I <= E1 <= J <= NUniform, independent, random input in the range.
