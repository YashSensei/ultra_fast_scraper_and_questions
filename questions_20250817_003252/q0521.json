  "text": "After eating dinner at a restaurant with some friends, you determine\r\nhow much money each person owes. Each of you has some cash and some\r\nchange, but very few of you have exact change. Can you make change\r\nfor each other so that each person ends up paying the exact right\r\namount?InputThe input file will contain multiple cases. The first line of each\r\ncase is N, the number of people at the table. This is followed\r\nby N lines, one for each i ∈ [1,N], containingxici,1ci,5ci,10ci,25ci,100ci,500ci,1000ci,2000ci,5000ci,10000where xiis the amount in cents that person i owes and ci,vis the number of coins or bills worth v cents that person i\r\nstarts out with. For example, person 1 has c1,1pennies, c1,5nickels, etc.\r\n\r\nEach case is followed immediately by the next case. The end of the\r\ninput is indicated by a line containing only a zero.\r\n\r\nYou may assume that no person owes more money than they have (i.e.\r\nxi≤ Σjj*ci,j) and that the total amount of money in cents that\r\neveryone starts with fits in a signed 32-bit integer. You may also\r\nassume that N ≤ 100000.OutputFor each case, output the case number, in the format \"Case #:\" (where # is the case number, starting at 1), followed by\r\na space, followed by \"YES\" if all of the money can\r\nbe rearranged so that each person ends up paying the correct amount\r\nand \"NO\" if not.ExampleInput:1\r\n10 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n2\r\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\r\n500 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\r\n1\r\n100 4 0 2 3 0 1 0 0 0 0\r\n0Output:Case 1: YES\r\nCase 2: YES\r\nCase 3: NO",
