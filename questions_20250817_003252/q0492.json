  "text": "In a seaside village, there is an avenue of skyscrapers. Each skyscrapers is 100m wide and has certain\r\nheight. Due to very high price of parcels, any two consecutive skyscrapers are adjacent. The avenue lies\r\nclose to the beach so the street is exactly at the sea level.\r\nUnfortunately, this year, due to the global warming, the sea level started to increase by one meter\r\neach day. If the skyscraper height is no greater than the current sea level, it is considered ﬂooded.\r\nA region is a maximal set of non-ﬂooded, adjacent skyscrapers. This term is of particular importance, as\r\nit is suﬃcient to deliver goods (like current, carrots or cabbages) to any single skyscraper in each region.\r\nHence, the city major wants to know how many regions there will be in the hard days that come.\r\nAn example of an avenue with 5 skyscrapers after 2 days is given below.InputThe input contains several test cases. The ﬁrst line contains an\r\nintegert(t ≤ 15) denoting the number\r\nof test cases. Thenttest cases follow. Each of them begins with a line containing two\r\nnumbersnandd(1 ≤ n, d ≤ 106),nis the number of skyscrapers anddis the number of days which the major wants to query. Skyscrapers are numbered from left to right. The next line\r\ncontains n integers h1, h2... hnwhere 1 ≤ hi≤ 109is the\r\nheight of skyscraperi. The third line of a single test case containsdnumbers tjsuch\r\nthat 0 ≤ t1< t2< ... < td−1< td≤ 109.OutputFor each test case output d numbers r1, r2... rd, where rjis\r\nthe number of regions on day tj.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 3\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 2 3\r\n5 3\r\n1 3 5 1 3\r\n0 2 4Output:1 1 0\r\n1 2 1",
