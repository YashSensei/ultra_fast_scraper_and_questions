  "text": "Suppose we have a sequence of non-negative integers, Namely a1, a2... an. \r\nAt each time we can choose one term aiwith 0 < i < n  and we subtract 1 from both aiand ai+1. \r\nWe wonder whether we can get a  sequence of all zeros after several operations.InputThe first line is the number of test cases T (0 < T ≤ 20).The first line of each test case is a number N (0 < N ≤ 10000). The next line is N non-negative integers, 0 ≤ ai≤ 109.OutputIf it can be modified into all zeros with several operations output“YES”in a single line, otherwise output“NO”instead.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n1 2\r\n2\r\n2 2Output:NO\r\nYESExplanationIt is clear that [1 2] can be reduced to [0 1] but no further to convert all integers to 0. Hence, the output is NO.In second case, output is YES as [2 2] can be reduced to [1 1] and then to [0 0] in just two steps.",
