After completing his extensive research on the squares of numbers, he has moved on to cubes.  Now he wants to know all numbers whose cube ends in 888.Given a numberk, help Mr. HKP find the kthnumber (indexed from 1) whose cube ends in 888.InputThe first line of the input contains an integert, the number of test cases.ttest cases follow.Each test case consists of a single line containing a single integerk(1 ≤k≤ 2000000000000).OutputFor each test case, output a single integer which denotes the kthnumber whose cube ends in 888.  The result will be less than 263.ExampleInput:1\r\n1Output:192",
