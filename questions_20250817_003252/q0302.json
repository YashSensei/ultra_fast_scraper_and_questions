Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case the first line of the input contains an integer n (1 <= n \r\n\t<= 50000) - the number of intervals. The following n lines describe the \r\n\tintervals. Line (i+1) of the input contains three integers ai, \r\n\tbiand ciseparated by single spaces and such that 0 < \r\n\t\t= ai< = bi<= 50000 and 1 < = ci< \r\n\t\t= bi-ai+1.OutputFor each test case the output contains exactly one integer equal to the minimal \r\n\tsize of set Z sharing at least cielements with interval [ai, \r\n\tbi], for each i= 1, 2, ..., n.ExampleSample input:1\r\n5\r\n3 7 3\r\n8 10 3\r\n6 8 1\r\n1 3 1\r\n10 11 1Sample output:6Warning: enormous Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
