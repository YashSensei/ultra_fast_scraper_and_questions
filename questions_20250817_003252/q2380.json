  "text": "EnglishVietnameseJohn has recently arrived in Bucharest for the South Eastern \nEuropean Regional Contest. John is famous for his theory of lucky \nnumbers. That’s why all the contestants and spectators are very happy. \nAccording to that theory  4 and  7 are lucky digits, and all the \nother digits are not lucky. A lucky number is a number that contains \nonly lucky digits in decimal notation. A very lucky number is a number \nthat can be expressed as a product of several lucky numbers. A lucky \nnumber by itself is considered to be very lucky. For  example, numbers \n47, 49, 112 are very lucky.Your task is to calculate the number of very lucky numbers that are \nnot less than A and not greater than B. Of course, numbers A and B are \ngiven by John.InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer T – a number \nof test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers separated \nby a single space – A and B.OutputOutput must contain T lines – answers for the test cases.Constraints:1 ≤ T ≤ 7777,1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1000000000000 (10^12).SampleInput :\n4 \n1 2 \n88 99 \n112 112 \n1 100 \n\nOutput: \n0 \n0 \n1 \n10Hint:  Very lucky numbers for the last case are 4, 7, 16, 28, 44, 47, 49, 64, 74 and 77.",
