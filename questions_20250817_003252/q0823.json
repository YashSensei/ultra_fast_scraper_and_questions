  "text": "Ada the Ladybug came home with difficult homework. Since she is very skilled mathematician, she already deduced, how to count the answer for N. Consider all numbersK(in range2 ≤ K ≤ N), for which it is true thatgcd(N,K)==1and addgcd(N,K-1)to sum. What is the sum?A little bit more formally, find: ∑ gcd(K-1,N), for K ∈ [2,N] where gcd(N,K)==1Anyway the numbers are too large, so she can't do that without your help. Can you help her?InputThe first line contains1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, number of test-cases.Each of followingTlines contains2 ≤ N ≤     1018, number for which Ada wants the answer.OutputFor each test case, print the sum of deduced formula.Example Input11\r\n2\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n10\r\n50\r\n100\r\n1000\r\n524288\r\n945406969379503350Example Output0\r\n3\r\n2\r\n5\r\n8\r\n6\r\n70\r\n260\r\n5400\r\n4718592\r\n1381966975399059833610",
