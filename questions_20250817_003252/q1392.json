  "text": "There is a rectangular area containing n × m cells. Two cells are marked\r\nwith “2”, and another two with “3”. Some cells are occupied by obstacles.\r\nYou should connect the two “2”s and also the two “3”s with non-intersecting\r\nlines. Lines can run only vertically or horizontally connecting centers\r\nof cells without obstacles.Lines cannot run on a cell with an obstacle. Only one line can run on\r\na cell at most once. Hence, a line cannot intersect with the other line,\r\nnor with itself. Under these constraints, the total length of the two\r\nlines should be minimized. The length of a line is defined as the\r\nnumber of cell borders it passes. In particular, a line connecting cells\r\nsharing their border has length 1.Fig. 1(a) shows an example setting. Fig. 1(b) shows two lines satisfying the\r\nconstraints above with minimum total length 18.Figure 1: An example of setting and its solutionInputThe input consists of multiple datasets, each in the following format.n m\r\n    row1\r\n    …\r\n    rownn is the number of rows which satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 9. m is the number of columns\r\nwhich satisfies 2 ≤ m ≤ 9. Each rowi is a sequence of m digits separated by\r\na space. The digits mean the following.0: Empty\r\n    1: Occupied by an obstacle\r\n    2: Marked with “2”\r\n    3: Marked with “3”The end of the input is indicated with a line containing two zeros separated\r\nby a space.OutputFor each dataset, one line containing the minimum total length of the two\r\nlines should be output. If there is no pair of lines satisfying the requirement,\r\nanswer “0” instead.Sample Input5 5\r\n0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 3 0\r\n2 0 2 0 0\r\n1 0 1 1 1\r\n0 0 0 0 3\r\n2 3\r\n2 2 0\r\n0 3 3\r\n6 5\r\n2 0 0 0 0\r\n0 3 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 2 3 0\r\n0 0Sample Output18\r\n2\r\n17",
