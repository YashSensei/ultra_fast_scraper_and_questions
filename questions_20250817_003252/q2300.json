  "text": "N people are lined up in a straight line to enter a concert. Each person in this line knows how many people in front have shorter or same heights. Let's call the sequence representing these numbers S. So in other words, S[i] means that there are S[i] people in front of the ith person who have shorter or same heights than that of person i.Given the heights of N people and a sequence S, determine the correct order of people lined up. (left is front)InputThe first line of the input is an integer N. (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000)The next N lines each consists of one integer H. (1 ≤ H ≤ 2×109) These N integers are the heights of people lined up.Then, sequence S is given in a single line, separated by a space.OutputDetermine the correct ordering of people lined up. Total of N lines should be output. The integer on the ith line represents the height of the ith person in the line.ExampleInput:121201671631721451341821551671201191560 1 0 0 3 2 6 7 4 6 9 4Output:134167120119156120167182155163172145",
