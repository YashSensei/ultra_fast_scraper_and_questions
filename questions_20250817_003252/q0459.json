  "text": "See problemSPYfor more background information.Blue Mary extremely likes making PPTs. She has already made2LPPTs. Now the only problem before finishing is to set the background pictures for each PPT. She has anoddnumber (denoted byN) of background pictures ranging from 0 toN-1inclusive. Each PPT needs exactly one background picture. Different PPTs can use same background pictures. Obviously, there areN2Lcombinations.For each combination, Blue Mary defines its weight as the sum of the IDs of the firstLPPTs minus the sum of the IDs of the lastLPPTs. Now Blue Mary wants to calculate the number of combinations with a positive weight. (Blue Mary is such a weird girl that she always does some meaningless calculations.) She asks you for help.Since this number can be quite large, Blue Mary only needs the number modulo a primeP.InputSeveral test cases, the number of which is less than 3333. Each test case consists of a single line with three space-separated integersN(1 ≤N≤ 3333),L(1 ≤L≤ 3333) andP(108≤P≤ 109). Input terminates by EOF.Input data is generated with almost log-uniform random distribution.OutputFor each test case, output the required value in a single line.ExampleInput:1 1 100000007\r\n3 2 999999937Output:0\r\n31",
