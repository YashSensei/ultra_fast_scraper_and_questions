She has broken up with him again!And after a series of break ups and patch ups, she is done with him!Being a geek to keep herself distracted, she picks up her favourite topic of dynamic programming where she comes across this idiot problem which says:Given a integer N, you have to tell the sum of number of structurally unique binary search trees built on different permutations of the set {x, x such that x belongs to [1, N] and x is an integer}.A binary search tree is said to be built on a permutation iff the in-order traversal of that BST is same as the permutation.A permutation is said to be distinct from another if there exists a position i such that the i'th element of the permutations is different.Now, her inability to solve the problem is quite stressful to her! Help her in solving the problem!Note: She observes that this number can be very large so output this number modulo 1908.Moreover she tells you that there in-order traversal of a binary search tree is unique.For binary search tree read Wikipedia'sbinary search tree.InputThe first line of the input consists of T, the number of test cases.The following T lines consists of a single integer N.(N can be at max 1000, T can be at max 1000)OutputYou have to output T lines each consisting of the answer to the problem modulo 1908.ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n2Output:1\r\n2",
