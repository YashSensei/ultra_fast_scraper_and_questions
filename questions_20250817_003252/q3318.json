  "text": "A new lord assumed the position by the death of the previous lord in a Far Eastern province.The new greedy lord hates concave polygons, because he believes they need much wasted area to be drawn on\r\npaper. He always wants to modify them to convex ones.His castle is currently surrounded by a wall forming a concave polygon, when seen from the above. Of course\r\nhe hates it. He believes more area could be obtained with a wall of a convex polygon. Thus he has ordered his\r\nvassals to have new walls built so they form a convex polygon.Unfortunately, there is a limit in the budget. So it might be infeasible to have the new walls built completely. The\r\nvassals has found out that only up tormeters of walls in total can be built within the budget. In addition, the new\r\nwalls must be built in such a way they connect the polygonal vertices of the present castle wall. It is impossible\r\nto build both of intersecting walls.After long persuasion of the vassals, the new lord has reluctantly accepted that the new walls might not be built\r\ncompletely. However, the vassals still want to maximize the area enclosed with the present and new castle walls,\r\nso they can satisfy the lord as much as possible.Your job is to write a program to calculate, for a given integerr, the maximum possible area of the castle with\r\nthe new walls.InputThe input file contains several test cases.Each case begins with a line containing two positive integersnandr.nis the number of vertices of the concave\r\npolygon that describes the present castle wall, satisfying 5 ≤n≤ 64.ris the maximum total length of new castle\r\nwalls feasible within the budget, satisfying 0 ≤r≤ 400.The subsequentnlines are thex- andy-coordinates of thenvertices. The line segments (xi,yi)–(xi+1,yi+1)\r\n(1 ≤i≤n- 1) and (xn,yn)–(x1,y1) form the present castle wall of the concave polygon. Those coordinates are\r\ngiven in meters and in the counterclockwise order of the vertices.All coordinate values are integers between 0 and 100, inclusive. You can assume that the concave polygon is\r\nsimple, that is, the present castle wall never crosses or touches itself.The last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.OutputFor each test case in the input, print the case number (beginning with 1) and the maximum possible area enclosed\r\nwith the present and new castle walls. The area should be printed with exactly one fractional digit.ExampleInput:5 4\r\n0 0\r\n4 0\r\n4 4\r\n2 2\r\n0 4\r\n8 80\r\n45 41\r\n70 31\r\n86 61\r\n72 64\r\n80 79\r\n40 80\r\n8 94\r\n28 22\r\n0 0Output:Case 1: 16.0\r\nCase 2: 3375.0",
