  "text": "Loki has succeeded in his devilish scheme and opened the portal to Asgard to summon his army to Earth.To protect Earth from this predicament, Iron Man must find a way to close this portal. He notices that the passcode on the portal is apalindromicstring S. Also no character in this string occurs more than2times. Iron man can remove any number of characters from this string. Genius that he is, he deduces that the portal will close whenever the string is not a palindrome. But that is too easy for him. So he waits and wonders how many different ways there are to achieve this. Two ways are considered different if there exists an i such that character at index i is removed in one way and not removed in another.InputThe first line of input contains a single line T, which represents the number of test cases. Then T lines will follow, and each contains a palindromic string S.OutputPrint the required answer for each test case in a new line. Since the number can be large print it modulo 1000000007.Constraints1 <= T <= 10001 <= |S| <= 100, where |S| represents the length of the string S.The string S is case-sensitive, and will contain only characters in the range [a-z], [A-Z], [0-9].There would be at most two positions in S which will contain same character.ExampleInput:2\r\nAA\r\nb99bOutput:0\r\n6ExplanationIn the first sample case there is no way in which string can be converted to non-palindrome.In the second sample case there are 6 ways to convert string to non-palindromic namely:Remove 1stcharacter: 99bRemove 1st, 2ndcharacters: 9bRemove 1st, 3rdcharacters: 9bRemove 2nd, 4thcharacters: b9Remove 3rd, 4thcharacters: b9Remove 4thcharacter: b99",
