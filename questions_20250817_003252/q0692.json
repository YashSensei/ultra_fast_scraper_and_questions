  "text": "All of must you know the game of Nim. For those who don’t know, I will describe the game in brief:There are two players and there are N piles. Each pile contains some stones. Player 1 takes the first turn, than player 2, than again player 1 and so on. At each turn, the player chooses any ONE pile, and removes at least one stone from it.The player who makes the last move wins.Now given N piles, your task is to find the number of ways Player 1 can start the game so that after his first move, he is in the winning position.  That means after Player 1 has removed some stones from any ONE pile, he will surely win the game if he plays optimally no matter how well Player 2 plays the game.InputInput starts with an integerT (≤ 1000), denoting the number of test cases.Each case starts with an integerN (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). The next line contains N integers all less than1000. The ithinteger denotes the number of stones in the ithpile.OutputFor each case, print the desired result.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n11 15 8\r\n3\r\n11 15 7Output:Case 1: 3\r\nCase 2: 3",
