  "text": "Due to A.M. Scott in the 19th century, it's an incomplete columnar transposition cipher with alternating single letters and digraphs. The first entry must be a digraph.

Plaintext letters are in [A-Z] only with no punctuation. The maximum keylength is 9 and the length of the plaintext is limited to 250. The last line ends with EOF.OutputOutput consist of exactly N lines of ciphertexts with letters in [A-Z] with no spaces.ExampleInput:41325 INCOMPLETECOLUMNARWITHALTERNATINGSINGLELETTERSANDDIGRAPHSOutput:CECRTEGLENPHPLUTNANTEIOMOWIRSITDDSINTNALINESAALEMHATGLRGR",
