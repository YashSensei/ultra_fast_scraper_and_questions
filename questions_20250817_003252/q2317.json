  "text": "You are given N numbers. You have to perform two kinds of operations:U x y - x-th number becomes equal to y.Q x y - calculate the sum of distinct numbers from x-th to y-th. It means that the sum for the set {1, 2, 3, 2, 7} will be equal to 13 (1+2+3+7).InputThe first line of input contains an integer N. 1 ≤ N ≤ 50000.The second line consists of N numbers.The third line consists of an integer Q. 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000. The following Q lines will consist of queries of the form described in the task description.All numbers in input will fit in the signed 32-bit type.OutputOutput an answer for every query of the second type.ExampleInput:51 2 4 2 33Q 2 4U 4 7Q 2 4Output:613Hint: Time limit is ~1.5*(my program's execution time in the worst case)",
