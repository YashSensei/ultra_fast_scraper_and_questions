On the following N lines, there are pairs of numbers describing each type of candy. The candy description is of the form kiciwhere kiis the number of that particular type of candy contained in the bag and ci is the calorie count for each piece of that type of candy. You may assume that 1 ≤ ki≤ 500 and 1 ≤ ci≤ 200.OutputYour output is one integer which is the minimum difference of calories between friendsExampleInput:4\r\n3 5\r\n3 3\r\n1 2\r\n3 100Output:74",
