  "text": "EnglishVietnameseJapan plans to welcome the ACM ICPC World Finals and a lot of roads must be built for the venue. Japan is tall island with N cities on the East coast and M cities on the West  coast  (M ≤ 1000, N ≤ 1000).  \nK superhighways will be build. Cities on each coast are numbered 1, 2, ... from North to South. Each superhighway is straight line and connects city on  the East coast with city of  the West coast.The  funding  for  the construction is guaranteed by ACM. A major portion of the sum is determined by the number of crossings between superhighways. At most two superhighways cross at one  location. Write a program that calculates the number of  the crossings between superhighways.InputThe input file starts with T - the number of test cases. Each test case starts with three numbers – N, M, K. Each of the next K lines contains two numbers – the numbers of cities connected by  the superhighway. The first one  is  the number of  the city on the East coast and second one is the number of the city of the West coast.OutputFor each test case write one line on the standard output:Test case \"case number\": \"number of crossings\"SampleInput:1\n3 4 4\n1 4\n2 3\n3 2\n3 1Output:Test case 1: 5",
