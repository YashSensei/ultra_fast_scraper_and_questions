The task is to find all keywords from a given string. A keyword is a word that contains at least one “#”. A word may contain other letters and punctuations. Given string will be split based on some delimiters. Rumman is so busy learning cutting edge technology for developing a project. So he assigned this task to you. You as a programmer will do the same thing.For example: Given string is “Here are some fruit name: #apple, #banana, #orange.”. Delimiters are “|$ *@.&\\\"!^,?”. So, the words containing “#” will be: “#apple”, “#banana”, “#orange”.Delimiters are, fixed for all string: “|$ *@.&\\\"!^,?”.InputInput starts with the number of test cases, T (1 <= T <= 10).Each line contains a string consisting letters and punctuations. (1 <= |string| <= 100).OutputFor each test case, print the keywords in a new line. If no keywords found, then print “No keywords.”ExampleInput:3\r\nab#c def#.\r\nAbcde fghijabc.efg#ijk #lMn.Output:ab#c\r\ndef#\r\nNo keywords.\r\nefg#ijk\r\n#lMn",
