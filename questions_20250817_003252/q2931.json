  "text": "A Palindromic number is a number without leading zeros that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For instance5, 22, 12321, 101101are Palindromic numbers where as10, 34, 566, 123421are not. A Prime number is a positive integer greater than1that has no positive divisors other than1and itself. For example,2, 31, 97are Prime numbers but1, 10, 25, 119are not. A Palindromic Prime number is both palindromic and prime at the same time.2, 3, 131are Palindromic Prime numbers but6, 17, 3333are not. Given a positive integerN, output the largest palindromic prime number not greater thanN.InputThe first line contains an integerTdenoting the number of test cases. Each of the subsequentTlines contain a single integerNwithout leading or trailing spaces.OutputPrintTlines. For each test case, print a single integer denoting the largest palindromic prime number which does not exceedN.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1062 ≤ N ≤ 1013ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n10\r\n666Output:2\r\n7\r\n383NoteLarge input and output, please use faster I/O methods.",
