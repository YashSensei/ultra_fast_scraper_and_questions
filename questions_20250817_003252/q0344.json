Each rectangle has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and integer coordinates of vertices.We define a block as follows:each rectangle is a block,if two distinct blocks have a common segment then they form the new block otherwise we say that these blocks are separate.ExamplesThe rectangles in Figure 1 form two separate blocks.The rectangles in Figure 2 form a single blockTaskWrite a program that for each test case:reads the number of rectangles and coordinates of their vertices;finds the number of separate blocks formed by the rectangles;writes the result to the standard output.InputThe number of test casestis in the first line of input, thenttest cases follow separated by an empty line.In the first line of a test case there is an integern, 1 ≤n≤ 7000, which is the number of rectangles. In the followingnlines there are coordinates of rectangles. Each rectangle is described by four numbers: coordinatesx,yof the bottom-left vertex and coordinatesx,yof the top-right vertex. All these coordinates are non-negative integers not greater than 10000.OutputFor each test case you should output one line with the number of separate blocks formed by the given rectangles.ExampleSample input:1\r\n9\r\n0 3 2 6\r\n4 5 5 7\r\n4 2 6 4\r\n2 0 3 2\r\n5 3 6 4\r\n3 2 5 3\r\n1 4 4 7\r\n0 0 1 4\r\n0 0 4 1Sample output:2",
