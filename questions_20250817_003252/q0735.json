  "text": "Some people who love strings have decided to call a special group of strings as the ”unique strings”.Let’s definea(S)as the number of characters “a” the string S contains, andb(S)as the number of characters “b” the string S contains.S is a unique string if:S only contains the characters “a” and “b”For every substring S’ of S, | a(S’) – b(S’) | ≤ 3For example, “abbab” is a unique string. However, “abbbba” is not because it includes the substring “bbbb” for which | a(“bbbb”) – b(“bbbb”) | = 4 > 3.Let’s say we sort the unique strings –first by length and then lexicographically. The Nthunique string is the string that appears in the position N in the sorted list. The first unique string is assigned the number 1.The first 12 unique strings in the sorted list are:a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, babInputA single number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1014). Your task is to find the Nthunique string in the sorted list.OutputA single line: the Nthunique string in the sorted list.ExampleInput:10Output:abbInput:19Output:abab",
