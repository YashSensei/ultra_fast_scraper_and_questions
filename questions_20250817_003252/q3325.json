  "text": "Given a positive odd integer K and two positive integers low and high, determine how many integers between low and high contain exactly K divisors.InputThe first line of the input contains a positive integer C (0 < C < 100,000), the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of a line containing three integers: K, low, and high (1 < K < 10000, 0 < low â‰¤ high < 1010). K will always be an odd integer.OutputOutput for each case consists of one line: the number of integers between low and high, inclusive, that contain exactly K divisors.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 2 49\r\n9 1 100\r\n5 55 235Output:4\r\n2\r\n1",
