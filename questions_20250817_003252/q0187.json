  "text": "Given any string of decimal digits, ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9, there is always a decimal number, which when cubed has a decimal expansion ending in the original given digit string. The number need never have more digits than the given digit string.Write a program, which takes as input a string of decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9 and finds a number of at most the same number of digits, which when cubed, ends in the given digit string.InputThe input begins with a line containing only the count of problem instances, nProb, as a decimal integer, 1 <= nProb <= 100. This is followed by nProb lines, each of which contains a string of between 1 and 10 decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9.OutputFor each problem instance, there should be one line of output consisting of the number, which when cubed, ends in the given digit string. The number should be output as a decimal integer with no leading spaces and no leading zeroes.If there are many answers, the minimum should be chosen.ExampleInput:4\r\n123\r\n1234567\r\n435621\r\n9876543213Output:947\r\n2835223\r\n786941\r\n2916344917",
