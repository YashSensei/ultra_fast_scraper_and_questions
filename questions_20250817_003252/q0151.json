It is also given that both the players will play optimally and Manoj always take the first turn.You have to find who will win the game.InputFirst line of each test case contains two integers N and M. (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 200) Each of next N lines contains an string, jth character on of ith string is '*' if there is an stone otherwise it is '.' (empty). Input ends when N, M = 0, 0. which is not to be processed.OutputFor each test case print 'Manoj' if Manoj wins, print 'Pankaj' otherwise.ExampleInput:2 2\r\n.*\r\n.*\r\n2 2\r\n.*\r\n*.\r\n0 0Output:Pankaj\r\nManoj",
