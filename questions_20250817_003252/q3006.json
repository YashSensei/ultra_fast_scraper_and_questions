  "text": "Apoorv has an array of n integers. Inversion count of an array is defined by number of pair of indices(i,j)  such that iarr[j]. You are given an integer p. Apoorv has to find the subarray with maximum inversion count among all subarrays of size p. Apoorv find this job very tough so he turns to you for help.Constraints :1<=n<=500000-1000000000<=arr[i]<=10000000001<=p<=nInputFirst line contains two integers n and p.Next line contains n space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.OutputOutput two space separated integers first integer should be thestarting index(1-based indexing) of the subarray and next integer would be thecount of inversions in that subarray.In case there is a tie in maximum inversion countÂ  print thesmalleststarting index among the subarrays having maximum inversion count.ExampleInput:10 515 51 44 44 76 50 29 88 48 50Output:5 6",
