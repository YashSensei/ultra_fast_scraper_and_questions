  "text": "Warning:Source code size limit is 2048B (half is enough) and time limit could not allow all language to get AC ; I got AC in 0.41s with language C. (Timing edited, 2017-02-11, after compiler changes).\r\nThemaindifficulty of the problem is to manage efficiently the given precomputed\r\nvaluesandthe memory available, in the given time. Have fun ;-)The MarchLeo invited all his friends to a giant meeting for peace in byteland.\r\nAll people came in bus which were all full.\r\nLast year, they werethousands of people.\r\nAs Leo like structured things, he thought to form groups.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, all the ways to form homogeneous team with the 4 people (A,B,C,D) were :{{A,B,C,D}} : one team of 4 (one way),\r\n{{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}} : four 'teams' of 1 (one way more),\r\n{{A,B}, {C,D}} or {{A,C}, {B,D}} or {{A,D}, {B,C}} : two teams of 2 (3 ways more).for a total of 5 ways. But this year many more people are awaited.\r\nAs the answer should not fit in a 64-bit container, you should give your answer modulo M7=1000000007.InputThe input starts with 2^12 useful precomputed values:\r\n factorial(i) MOD M7 for i in [0 ; 2^30[ with a step of 2^18, each one on one line.\r\nThe input continues with the number T of test cases in a single line.\r\nIn each of the next T lines there are two integers : N, K.\r\nN is the quantity of bus that came to the meeting.\r\nK is the common capacity of each bus.OutputFor each test case, your task is to calculate the number of ways people\r\ncan form homogeneous teams.ExampleInput:1            <--- 0! mod M7\r\n639926614    <--- (2^18)! mod M7\r\n[...]        ( 4093 lines more)\r\n0            <--- (2^30 - 2^18)! mod M7\r\n3\r\n2 2\r\n1 6\r\n2 3Output:5\r\n27\r\n27Constraints0 < T ≤ 300\r\n0 < K ≤ 30000\r\n0 < N ≤ 30000Uniform-random input in the range.",
