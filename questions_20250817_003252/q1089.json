It's the same problem with this one and its time limit is not so strict, but tests are easier than this problem.LogThe time limit of this problem has been changed from 0.4/0.5 second to 1 second per test on Jun.5, 2008. All the solutions have been rejudged.Due to compiler changes, the time limit has been shorten to 0.1 second per test.",
