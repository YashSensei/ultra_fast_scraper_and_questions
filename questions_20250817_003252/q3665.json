  "text": "For every given number n we define x(n) as distance from n to the first number after n in form of 99...99. For example x(100)=899, x(45)=54, etc. Given several n numbers you have to find the Zp, where x(n) ≡ n (mod p).InputFirst line of input contains one number T (T < 20) - the number of test cases. In each of the next T lines contains one number each to represent n (0 < n < 30000000).OutputIn each line you have to write one number - the least p > 1 that x(n) ≡ n (mod p). If there is no such p the line should contain -1.ExampleInput:2\r\n234\r\n5Output:3\r\n-1Explanationx(234)=765. 765 mod 3=0, 234 mod 3=0 => 765 ≡ 234 (mod 3)",
