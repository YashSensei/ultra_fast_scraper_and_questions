Your task is to help Van Helsing calculate the exact amount of gunpowder that he will need, i.e., the volume of the powder magazine.InputThe first line of input contains an integer 1 ≤T≤ 100 representing the number of test cases. For each of the following lines contain an integer 0 ≤R≤ 100, as shown above.OutputFor each case print one line containing the amount of gunpowder that Van Helsing needs, with 4 decimal places.ExampleInput:2\r\n0\r\n1Output:0.0000\r\n4.6863",
