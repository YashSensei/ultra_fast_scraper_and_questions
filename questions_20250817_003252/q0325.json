  "text": "Consider a city bounded by a square, whose n horizontal and n vertical streets \r\n\tdivide it into (n+1)2square blocks. However, in tribute to the \r\n\tancient traditions of the first dwellers (who tended to overindulge in \r\n\talcohol), all the inhabitants live at crossroads. A group of friends would like \r\n\tto meet for an evening of merriment at the place of residence of one of them. \r\n\tWith a good deal of foresight, anticipating the difficulties they might have \r\n\tgetting back to their respective homes, they would like to meet in the house of \r\n\tthe friend which minimises the total walking distance for all of them. Assume \r\n\tthat everybody walks along the streets, turning only at crossroads, and the \r\n\tdistance between any pair of adjacent crossroads is 1.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case the first line of input contains the integer n - the number \r\n\tof friends who want to meet (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000). The next n lines contain two \r\n\tintegers each, the i-th being xiyi, standing for the x \r\n\tand y coordinates of the crossroads at which the i-th friend lives (0 ≤ xi, yi≤ 100000).OutputFor each test case output the total distance covered by all friends when \r\n\twalking to the meeting place.ExampleSample input:1\r\n7\r\n1 3\r\n3 2\r\n3 5\r\n6 9\r\n10 1\r\n12 4\r\n5 7Sample output:39Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
