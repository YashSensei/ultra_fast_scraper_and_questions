  "text": "There areNunique colors in the universe, numbered from1toN. George Michael wants to create a rainbow using these colors. The rainbow will consist of exactlyMlayers. For each layer, George Michael selects a color uniformly randomly from theNcolors and colors the layer with it.\r\n\r\nGeorge Michael wonders what will be the expected number of distinct colors in the rainbow after all the layers are colored in this way.InputThe first line of the input contains an integerT, denoting the number of test cases. Each of the nextTlines will contain two integers,NandM.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ N, M ≤ 2 * 105OutputFor each test case, print the case number and the expected number of distinct colors in the rainbow after all the layers are colored. Formally, let the expected number of distinct colors be an irreducible fractionP / Q. Then you need to print(P * Q-1)modulo1000000007, whereQ-1is the modular inverse ofQmodulo1000000007. You may safely assume that there will be a unique modular inverse ofQmodulo1000000007.Sample Input3\r\n1 1\r\n2 2\r\n4 2Sample OutputCase 1: 1\r\nCase 2: 500000005\r\nCase 3: 750000007ChallengeToo easy?
