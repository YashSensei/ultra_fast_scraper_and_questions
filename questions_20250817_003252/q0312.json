  "text": "You are chief debugger for Poorly Guarded Privacy, Inc. One of the top\r\nselling product, ReallySecureAgent©, seems to have a problem with\r\nits prime number generator. It produces from time to time bogus primes\r\nN.After a while, you realize that the problem is due to the way primes\r\nare recognized. Every phony prime N you discover can be characterized as follows. It is\r\nodd and has distinct prime factors, sayN = p1× p2× ...  × pkwithpi≠ pjwhere the number k of factors is at least 3.Moreover, for all i = 1..k, pi- 1 divides N - 1. For instance,561 = 3 × 11 × 17is a phony prime.Intrigued by this phenomenon, you decide to write a program that\r\nenumerates all such N's in a given interval[Nmin, Nmax]with1 ≤ Nmin< Nmax< 231, \r\nNmax- Nmin< 106.Please note, that the source code limit for this problem is 2000 bytes to avoid precalculated tables.InputEach test case contains one line. On this line are written two\r\nintegers Nminand Nmaxseparated\r\nby a blank. The end of the input is signalled by a line containing two\r\nzeros. The number of test cases is approximately 2000.OutputFor each test case, output the list of phony primes in increasing order, one per line. If there are no phony primes in the interval, then simply output none on a line.ExampleInput:10 2000\r\n20000 21000\r\n0 0Output:561\r\n1105\r\n1729\r\nnone",
