  "text": "Arya is very fond of Fibonacci numbers. He claimed he can solve any problem on Fibonacci number. His clever friend Golu gave him a challenge to prove his skills. He gave him a sequence which he called exponacci. The sequence is given by:g(n) = 2f(n-1)for n > 0g(0) = 1 for n == 0f(n) denotes the nth Fibonacci number wheref(0) = 1 (Obviously Golu is not as good as Arya in Fibonacci numbers so he believes f(0) = 1, anyways we have chosen not to disturb him.)f(1) = 1f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 1Help Arya to find the nth exponacci number. Since the numbers can be very large take mod 109+7.InputThe first line of the input will be the number of test cases (T ≤ 2000). For each test case first line contains one integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1015)Warning: value of n won't fit in int, use long long int instead.OutputThe value of g(n) % (109+7)SampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n5Output:4\r\n32",
