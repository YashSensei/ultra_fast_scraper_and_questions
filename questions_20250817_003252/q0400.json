  "text": "Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000)\r\nstalls. The stalls are located along a straight line at positions\r\nx1 ... xN (0 ≤ xi ≤ 1,000,000,000).His C (2 ≤ C ≤ N) cows don't like this barn layout and become\r\naggressive towards each other once put into a stall. To prevent the\r\ncows from hurting each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the\r\nstalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is\r\nas large as possible.  What is the largest minimum distance?Inputt– the number of test cases, thenttest cases follows.Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and CLines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains an integer stall location, xiOutputFor each test case output one integer: the largest minimum distance.ExampleInput:1\r\n5 3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n8\r\n4\r\n9Output:3ExplanationFJ can put his 3 cows in the stalls at positions 1, 4 and 8, resulting in \r\na minimum distance of 3.",
