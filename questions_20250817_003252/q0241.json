  "text": "Correct Bracket Sequence (CBS) is a sequence that can be obtained through following rules:An empty string is a CBS.If A is a CBS, then B = (A) is also a CBS.If A is a CBS, then B = [A] is also a CBS.If A and B are CBS, then C = AB is also a CBS.Length of the CBS is the number of brackets in it, and this number is always even.Assume that '(' < ')' < '[' < ']'.CBS a1a2 ... an is lexicographically smaller than the CBS b1b2 ... bn if and only if there exists an integer i, i ≤ n, so that aj = bj, for each j, 1 ≤ j < i and ai < bi.IllustrationEnumerate all CBS length 4 in lexicographical order:\r\n(()), ()(), ()[], ([]), [()], [[]], [](), [][].TaskYour task is to find k-th CBS with length n in lexicographical order.InputContains 2 integers n (2 .. 250) and k (1 .. 10120)OutputPrint the k-th CBS with length n in lexicographical order.ExampleInput:4\r\n3Output:()[]",
