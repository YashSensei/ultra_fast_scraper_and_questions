  "text": "DevG likes too much fun to do with numbers. \r\nOnce his friend Arya came and gave him a challenge, \r\nhe gave DevG an array of digits which is forming a number currently (will be called as given number). \r\nDevG was challenged to find the just next greater number which can be formed using digits of given number. \r\nNow DevG needs your help to find that just next greater number and win the challenge.InputThe first line have t number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). \r\nIn next 2×t lines for each test case first there is number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000) \r\nwhich denotes the number of digits in given number and \r\nnext line contains n digits of given number separated by space.OutputPrint the just next greater number if possible else print -1 in one line for each test case.Note :There will be no test case which contains zero in starting digits of any given number.ExampleInput:2\r\n5\r\n1 5 4 8 3\r\n10\r\n1 4 7 4 5 8 4 1 2 6Output:15834\r\n1474584162",
