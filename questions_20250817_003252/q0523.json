  "text": "It's Bessie's birthday and time for party games! Bessie has instructed the N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) cows conveniently numbered 1..N to sit in a circle (so that cow i [except at the ends] sits next to cows i-1 and i+1; cow N sits next to cow 1). Meanwhile, Farmer John fills a barrel with one billion slips of paper, each containing some integer in the range 1..1,000,000.Each cow i then draws a number Ai(1 ≤ Ai≤ 1,000,000) (which is not necessarily unique, of course) from the giant barrel.  Taking turns, each cow i then takes a walk around the circle and pats the heads of all other cows j such that her number Aiis exactly divisible by cow j's number Aj; she then sits again back in her original position.The cows would like you to help them determine, for each cow, the number of other cows she should pat.InputLine 1: A single integer: N.Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: Ai.OutputLines 1..N: On line i, print a single integer that is the number of other cows patted by cow i.ExampleInput:5\r\n2\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4Output:2\r\n0\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3The first cow pats the second and third cows; the second cows pats no cows; etc.",
