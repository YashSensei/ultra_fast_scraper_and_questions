  "text": "Two players, A and B, play the following game.First, a matrix M of size N × M is chosen, and filled with non-zero numbers.Player A starts the game and the players play alternately.In his turn, a player chooses any row which has at least one non zero number in it. In this row, the left-most non zero number is chosen. Let this number be K. The player subtracts any number between 1 and K inclusive from it.The game ends when all the numbers in the matrix M are 0.The player who plays last wins the game.Given N, M and the initial matrix, determine who wins the game. Assume that both players play optimally.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Each test case consists of 2 numbers N and M. There follow N lines each having M integers. The jth number on the ith line is the number M[i][j]. There is a blank line between consecutive test cases.OutputOutput T lines, one for each case. Output \"FIRST\" if player A wins, else output \"SECOND\".ConstraintsT ≤ 10001 ≤ N, M ≤ 50The initial matrix values are between 1 and 50 inclusive.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 2\r\n1 1\r\n1 1\r\n\r\n1 3\r\n2 1 1\r\n\r\n2 2\r\n3 2\r\n3 2Output:SECOND\r\nFIRST\r\nSECOND",
