The question is very very simple and easier than that you cannot imagine. You have to count total number of such primes p in the range[a â‰¥ 0, b > 0]so that(p2+ 1) or/and (p2+ 2) is/are prime(s).InputFirst line of input is t,(t < 100)total number of test cases. Next t lines contains two integers a and b separated by space.a < 50001, b < 100001 and b > a.OutputIn each line print total numbers of such prime numbers.ExampleInput:20 14 5Output:20[Consider 0 and 1 as prime numbers for this question]",
