You can swap it with the number in the j-th position if the following conditions hold:| i â€“ j | = dk, where k=1..3 and (d1,d2,d3,d4)=(1;3;6;12)floor(i/dk+1)=floor(j/dk+1)Your task is to find the minimum number of exchange operations required to sort the sequence in increasing order.InputThe first line of the input file contains an integer representing the number of test cases to follow.\r\nEach test case contains a sequence of twelve numbers consisting of 0,1,2,..,11, separated by single space.\r\nYou can assume that the given sequence can always be sorted in increasing order by using the exchange operationsOutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of exchange operations required to sort the given sequence in increasing order.ExampleInput:2\r\n1 10 2 3 0 5 7 4 8 6 9 11\r\n6 4 1 0 3 5 9 7 2 10 11 8Output:8\r\n9",
