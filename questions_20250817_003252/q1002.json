  "text": "A number is called a tree_num if it can be partition into sum of some distinct powers of 3 with natural exponent. Example : 13 and 90 are tree_num because 13 = 32+ 31+ 30, 90 = 34+ 32.Let $tree\\_num(i)$ be the i-th tree_num.Example : $tree\\_num(1) = 1$, $tree\\_num(2) = 3$, $tree\\_num(5) = 10$, …Let $$F(L, R) = \\sum _{i = L}^R tree\\_num(i)$$Your task is to find F(L, R) with some given L, R.Input- First line : an integer T – number of testcases (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000)- Next T lines : each line contains two number – L and R (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1018)Output- For each pair (L, R), output a line containing the value F(L, R). Since those values can be very large, just output them modulo 232ExampleInput:5\r\n1 3\r\n3 3\r\n4 5\r\n6 7\r\n2 5Output:8\r\n4\r\n19\r\n25\r\n26",
