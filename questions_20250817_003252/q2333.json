  "text": "Nowadays, people who want to communicate in a secure way use asymmetric encryption algorithms such as RSA. However, my older brother uses another, simpler encryption method for his diary entries. He uses a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is substituted by another letter from the alphabet. The distance between the plaintext letter and the encrypted letter is fixed. If we would define this fixed distancedto5, A would be replaced by F, B by G, C by H ... Y by D, Z by E.With a fixed and known distancedthe decryption would be somewhat simple. But my brother uses random distances for each of his diary entries. To decrypt his diary I have to guess the distancedfor each entry. Thus, I use the well known phenomenon that the letter E is used more often in English words than other letters.  Can you write a program for me that calculates the distancedbased on the fact that the most used letter in the encrypted text corresponds to the letter E in plaintext? Of course, I am interested in the decrypted text, too.InputThe input consists of several test casescthat follow (1 ≤ c ≤ 100). Each test case is given in exactly one line containing one diary entry. Diary entries only use upper case letters (A-Z) and spaces. Each diary entry consists of at most1000encrypted letters (including spaces).OutputFor each test case, print one line containing the smallest possible distanced(0 ≤ d ≤ 25) and the decrypted text. If the decryption is not possible because there are multiple distances conforming to the rules above, printNOT POSSIBLEinstead. Spaces are not encrypted.ExampleInput:4\r\nRD TQIJW GWTYMJWX INFWD JSYWNJX ZXJ F XNRUQJ JSHWDUYNTS YJHMSNVZJ\r\nTHE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG\r\nXVIDRE TFCCVXZRKV GIFXIRDDZEX TFEKVJK UVTIPGKZFE\r\nXVIDRE TFCCVXZRKV GIFXIRDDZEX TFEKVJKOutput:5 MY OLDER BROTHERS DIARY ENTRIES USE A SIMPLE ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUE\r\n10 JXU GKYSA RHEMD VEN ZKCFI ELUH JXU BQPO TEW\r\n17 GERMAN COLLEGIATE PROGRAMMING CONTEST DECRYPTION\r\nNOT POSSIBLE",
