  "text": "Lucifer MorningStar is interested in deepest desires of Zing. Being a programmer Zing said he has a desire of knowing number of magical substrings in a string. A substring of string S is said to be magical if it contains at least one magical character (A character is magical if its value is prime, and we assign values to characters as:  A is assigned 1, B is assigned 2 ... Z is assigned 26). So you have to calculate total number of magical substrings for S in order to help Lucifer who is absolutely newbie in programming, so that he does not disappoint Zing.InputFirst line contains number of test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 10).For each case input will contain two lines:First line contains length of string N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).Second line will contain a string S of length N. String will only contain uppercase letters.OutputFor each test case output a single integer denoting number of magical substrings of S in new line.ExampleInput:1\r\n3\r\nABCOutput:5",
