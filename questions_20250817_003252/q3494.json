  "text": "Lumberjack Mirko needs to chop downMmetres of wood. It is an easy job for him since he has a nifty new woodcutting machine that can take down forests like wildfire. However, Mirko is only allowed to cut a single row of trees.Mirko‟s machine works as follows: Mirko sets a height parameterH(in metres), and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts off all tree parts higher thanH(of course, trees not higher thanHmeters remain intact). Mirko then takes the parts that were cut off. For example, if the tree row contains trees with heights of 20, 15, 10, and 17 metres, and Mirko raises his sawblade to 15 metres, the remaining tree heights after cutting will be 15, 15, 10, and 15 metres, respectively, while Mirko will take 5 metres off the first tree and 2 metres off the fourth tree (7 metres of wood in total).Mirko isecologicallyminded, so he doesn‟t want to cut off more wood than necessary. That‟s why he wants to set his sawblade as high as possible. Help Mirko find themaximum integer heightof the sawblade that still allows him to cut offat least Mmetres of wood.InputThe first line of input contains two space-separated positive integers,N(the number of trees, 1 ≤N≤ 1 000 000) andM(Mirko‟s required wood amount, 1 ≤M≤ 2 000 000 000).The second line of input containsNspace-separated positive integers less than 1 000 000 000, the heights of each tree (in metres). The sum of all heights will exceedM, thus Mirko will always be able to obtain the required amount of wood.OutputThe first and only line of output must contain the required height setting.ExampleInput:4 7\r\n20 15 10 17Output:15Input:5 20\r\n4 42 40 26 46Output:36",
