  "text": "Digo is given a rooted tree where nodes are numbered from 1 to N (1 is the root node) and asked some queries on it.There are two types of queries:Given node number U, two integers X, K which means add X to the given node, X+K to its children, X+2×K to children of its children and so on.Given a node number U print the sum of nodes in the subtree rooted at U (including node U).Since the answer can be too long, print the answer 109+ 7Initially each node contains zero.InputFirst line contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.Next N-1 lines denotes the parent node of nodes 2 to N. (1 is the root node it has no parent.)Next line contains M (Number of queries.)In each of the next M lines first integer is T which means the type of the query. If T is 1, it is followed by three integers U, X, K as explained in the question. If T is 2, it is followed by a single integer U.OutputFor each query of type 2, output a single line containing the required answer.Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 1000001 ≤ M ≤ 1000001 ≤ X, K ≤ 1000000000SampleInput7\r\n1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n5\r\n1 1 1 2\r\n2 1\r\n2 3\r\n1 3 2 1\r\n2 3Output27\r\n13\r\n21",
