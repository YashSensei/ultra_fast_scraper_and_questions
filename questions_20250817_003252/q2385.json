  "text": "Some of the more elite (and not-so-elite) coders around take part in a certain unnamed programming contest. In said contest, there are multiple types of competitions. Here, we consider the Open and High School competition types. For each type, each competitor receives arating, an integer between 1 and 100000, inclusive. A coder's rating is based upon his or her level of performance in matches and is calculated using a complicated formula which, thankfully, you will not be asked to implement.Although the Open and High School ratings for a coder who has participated in both competition types lately are usually close, this is not always the case. In particular, High School matches are more about speed, since many coders are able to solve all the problems, whereas Open matches require more thinking and there is a steeper curve in terms of problem difficulty.Problem StatementYou are givenNcoders (1 ≤N≤ 300000), conveniently numbered from 1 toN. Each of these coders participates in both High School and Open matches. For each coder, you are also given an Open ratingAiand a High School ratingHi. Coderiis said to bebetterthan coderjif and only if both of coderi's ratings are greater than or equal to coderj's corresponding ratings, with at least one being greater. For each coderi, determine how many coders coderiis better than.InputOn the first line of input is a single integerN, as described above.Nlines then follow. Linei+1 contains two space-separated integers,AiandHi.OutputLineishould contain the number of coders that coderiis better than.ExampleInput:8\r\n1798 1832\r\n862 700\r\n1075 1089\r\n1568 1557\r\n2575 1984\r\n1033 950\r\n1656 1649\r\n1014 1473Output:6\r\n0\r\n2\r\n4\r\n7\r\n1\r\n5\r\n1",
