  "text": "You are given the scores of several players in a competition. Your task is to create a ranklist of the\r\nplayers, sorted in decreasing order by score.Unfortunately, the data structure used for the list of players supports only one operation, which\r\nmoves a player from position i to position j without changing the relative order of other players. If\r\ni > j, the positions of players at positions between j and i − 1 increase by 1, otherwise if i < j the\r\npositions of players at positions between i + 1 and j decrease by 1.This operation takes i steps to locate the player to be moved, and j steps to locate the position\r\nwhere he or she is moved to, so the overall cost of moving a player from position i to position j is\r\ni + j. Here, positions are numbered starting with 1.Determine a sequence of moves to create the ranklist such that the sum of the costs of the moves is\r\nminimized.InputThe input consists ofexactly 10test cases. The first line of each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000),\r\nthe number of players. Each of the following n lines contains one non-negative integer si(0 ≤ si≤ 1000000), the scores of the players in the current order. You may assume that all scores are distinct.OutputFor each test case, print in one line the number of moves used to create the ranklist. The following lines should specify the moves in the\r\norder in which they are applied. Each move should be described by a line containing two integers i\r\nand j, which means that the player at position i is moved to position j. The numbers i and j must be\r\nseparated by a single space.Examplehere only one test caseInput:5\r\n20\r\n30\r\n5\r\n15\r\n10Output:2\r\n2 1\r\n3 5",
