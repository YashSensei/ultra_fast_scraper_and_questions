  "text": "A word is a string of two or more letters while a code is a string of one or more distinct words\r\nin lexicographic order. Thus a string of letters may represent either a word or\r\na code. An optimum code is a code that contains the maximum number of words.For a given string of letters there may be one or more optimum codes. The optimum code of top\r\npriority is the optimum code that appears at the top when all optimum codes are arranged in\r\nlexicographic order.Given a string of letters, you are required to write a program that finds the\r\nfollowing:The total number of words,min an optimum code,The total number of optimum codes,nrepresented by the string,The optimum code of top priority, the top-code.InputInput consists of multiple test cases.For each test case there is only one line of input. It contains a string of at most\r\n100 letters.A line consisting of a single letter terminates input.OutputFor each test case, present output in two lines.The first line gives the two integersmandndefined above. The next line gives the optimum\r\ncode of top priority, the top-code.ExampleInput:aaaaaa\r\nwords\r\nlexicographic\r\naOutput:2 1\r\naa aaaa\r\n1 1\r\nwords\r\n3 2\r\nlexic og raphicKanpur-Kolkata 2004-2005",
