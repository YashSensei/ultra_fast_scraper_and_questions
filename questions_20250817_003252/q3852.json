  "text": "Mr. Avantgarde has 2 binary strings s1 and s2. He wants to convert s1 into s2. But this task isn't as easy as it looks. He has to convert s1 to s2 in exactly k steps. In each step, he can select exactly m chars and xor each of them by 1. Help him to find in how many ways can he convert s1 into s2 by using method described above. Output answer modulo 1000000009.ConstraintsTest cases ≤ 10Length of s1 = length of s2 ≤ 100m ≤ length of stringk ≤ 100InputFirst line will contain number of test cases. First line of test case contains s1. Second line of test case contains s2. Third line of test case contains m and k.OutputFor each test case, output result in a new line.SampleInput:2\r\n000\r\n111\r\n1 3\r\n000\r\n110\r\n2 4Output:6\r\n20",
