  "text": "A number is calledn-factorful if it has exactlyndistinct prime factors. Given positive integersa,b, andn, your task is to find the number of integers betweenaandb, inclusive, that aren-factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.InputYour input will consist of a single integerTfollowed by a newline andTtest cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing integersa,b, andnas described above.T< 100001 ≤a≤b≤ 1060 ≤n≤ 10OutputOutput for each test case one line containing the number ofn-factorful integers in [a,b].ExampleInput:5\r\n1 3 1\r\n1 10 2\r\n1 10 3\r\n1 100 3\r\n1 1000 0Output:2\r\n2\r\n0\r\n8\r\n1",
