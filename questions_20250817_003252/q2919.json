  "text": "You've been invited to the \"I-Love-Kd-trees\" annual con, but first, you have to show them that you really know about great data structures, so they give you an easy task!You are given a list ofNnumbers andQqueries, each query consist of three integers:k,iandl; letdbe thek-thsmallest element until the indexi(i.e. if the first i+1 elements were sorted in non-descending way,dwould be the element at indexk - 1). Then, the answer to each query is the index of thel-thoccurrence ofdin the array. If there's no such index, the answer is-1. You have to consider that all indexes are counted starting with0.InputInput consists of one test case.The first line contains two integers,N(1 ≤ N ≤ 105) andQ(1 ≤ Q ≤ 105).The next line containsNpossibly distinct integersai(-109≤ ai≤ 109).ThenQlines follow, each of those contains three integersk,iandl. (0 < k ≤ i < N, 1 ≤ l ≤ N).OutputFor each query (in the same order as the input) output a single line with the answer to that query.ExampleInput:10 62 6 7 1 8 1 2 3 2 62 4 22 6 31 4 11 4 23 4 23 3 2Output:6-13599Explanation of the first query:The elements until index 4 are [2, 6, 7, 1, 8] so the 2nd smallest element is 2, and your asked for the index of its 2nd occurrence, so the answer is 6.",
