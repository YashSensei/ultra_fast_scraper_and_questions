  "text": "Bird treeThe Bird tree1is an infinite binary tree, whose first 5 levels look as follows:It can be defined as follows:This is aco-recursivedefinition in which both occurrences ofbirdrefer to the full (infinite) tree. The expressionbird+ 1 means that 1 is added to every fraction in the tree, and 1∕birdmeans that every fraction in the tree is inverted (soa∕bbecomesb∕a).Surprisingly, the tree contains every positive rational number exactly once, so every reduced fraction is at a unique place in the tree. Hence, we can also describe a rational number by giving directions (Lfor left subtree,Rfor right subtree) in the Bird tree. For example,2∕5is represented byLRR. Given a reduced fraction, return a string  consisting ofL’s andR’s: the directions to locate this fraction from the top of the tree.InputOn the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:one line with two integersaandb(1  ≤a,b≤ 109), separated by a’/’. These       represent the numerator and denominator of a reduced fraction. The integersaandbare not both equal to 1, and they satisfy gcd(a,b) = 1.For every test case the length of the string with directions will be at most 10000.OutputPer test case:one line with the string representation of the location of this fraction in the Bird tree.Sample in- and outputInputOutput3\r\n1/2\r\n2/5\r\n7/3L\r\nLRR\r\nRLLR1Hinze, R.
