Your task is to find maximum length of substringPofSwhich occurs at leastNtimes.If there are multiple solutions then substring with right most occurrence is preferred.InputFirst line will containT, denoting number of test cases. Each test case consist of two lines. The first line contains the stringSand the next line contains the integerN.OutputIf there is no solution, outputHATE, otherwise, print two integers in a line, separated by a space. The first integer denotes the maximum length of a substring appearing at leastNtimes; the second integer gives the rightmost possible starting position of such a substring.Constraints0 <T≤ 101 ≤|S|≤ 500001 ≤N≤ |S|S consists of only lowercase letters.SampleInput:3\r\naaaaaaa\r\n3\r\nbabab\r\n2\r\nabcde\r\n3Output:5 3\r\n3 3\r\nHATE",
