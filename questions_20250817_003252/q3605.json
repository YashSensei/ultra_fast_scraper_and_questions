  "text": "A positive integer is said to be bitwise prime if the sum of all the bits in its binary representation is a prime number.You are given two integers a and b. You have to output number of bitwise prime numbers between a and b (inclusive).InputFirst line contains T : number of test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 105)For next T lines, each test case contains two space separated integers a and b. (a ≤ b). 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1019.OutputFor each test case, print the number of bitwise prime numbers between a and b (inclusive).ExampleInput:21 21 3Output:01",
