  "text": "As you mightalready     know, Ada the Ladybug is growing plants. She used to have a very long furrow, yet it costs a fortune to fence it. To reduce it, she has decided to build a square field. It is so big, that most of water falling from rains drops just onto a rectangular part of the field. Ada doesn't want the plants to wither, so she records all rains to know, how much water every particular plant got. Sadly, there are so many rains that she couldn't handle this alone!At first, you will be givenNqueries with[x, y], [X, Y]rectangles telling you, where all of theNrains has fallen (lower left / upper right corners of it). AfterwardMqueries follow, with numberi- the i-th plant for which you want to know, the number of rains, which has fallen onto it.InputThe first line will contain0< N, M ≤ 3×105,0< L ≤ 5000, number of rains, number of questions and size of square field.ThenNlines follow, each containing four integersx, y, X, Y(1 ≤ x ≤ X ≤ L, 1 ≤ y ≤ Y ≤ L), bottom-left and upper-right corner of rectangle where ithrain has fallen.AfterwardMlines follow, each containing two numbers1 ≤ x, y ≤ L, asking for number of rains which has fallen onto plant on coordinates[x, y]OutputPrintMlines (for each query of second type), with integer indicating number of rains, which has fallen onto the plant in query.Example Input6 16 4\r\n1 1 3 4\r\n1 1 3 3\r\n2 2 2 2\r\n4 2 4 3\r\n3 3 4 4\r\n1 2 2 4\r\n1 1\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n2 1 \r\n2 2\r\n2 3\r\n2 4\r\n3 1\r\n3 2\r\n3 3\r\n3 4\r\n4 1\r\n4 2\r\n4 3\r\n4 4Example Output2\r\n3\r\n3\r\n2\r\n2\r\n4\r\n3\r\n2\r\n2\r\n2\r\n3\r\n2\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n1",
