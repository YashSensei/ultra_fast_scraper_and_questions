  "text": "Asad is a 10 years old boy. He loves to learn new logic from computer science.Palindromeis an interesting topic to him. So, He starts practicing to finding palindrome in his everyday life.A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward. such as – madam, 0001000 etc.He faces a problem and asks for your help. You are a great programmer in our country.Now, you have given a stringS.  You have to do a permutation of stringSthrough many times (can be 0 times) such that you will get a palindromic stringP. You have to check whether it is possible to form a palindrome after any permutation or not.InputEvery line of the input contains a single stringS.Constraints:Swill consist only of lowercase English letters (i.e. characters 'a' through 'z').1 ≤|S|≤ 105OutputFor each test case, print a single line. Print 1, if it is possible to find at least one valid permutationPof stringSwhich is a palindrome. Otherwise print -1.ExampleInput:abc\r\nababOutput:-1\r\n1Note:In, Case 2: ‘baab’ is a valid permutations of string ‘abab’ which is also a palindrome. So output will be 1.",
