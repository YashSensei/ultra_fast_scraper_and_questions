  "text": "It is during the great war in the year 2240 that the Robinson family decides to leave the human\r\nempire, in search for more peaceful and quiet places. The Robinsons already have a planet in\r\nmind to which they wish to travel and want to get there as soon as possible. However, because\r\nall vehicles capable of spaceflight are being used for the war, the Robinson family has no way to\r\nescape to other planets by means of ordinary spaceflight. It is therefore that Joe Robinson, the\r\nfather of the family, created the Robintron. The Robintron is a vehicle that is capable of travelling\r\nfrom one planet's surface to another by only using the forces of gravity.It is the gravitational pull of a planet that keeps the Robintron on a planet's surface. This\r\npull extends as far as the planet's gravity well, a circular area around the center of the planet,\r\nwhich is generated by the planet's mass. However, these gravity wells can also be used to assist\r\nthe Robintron in leaving a planet by the way of planet hopping. Planet hopping can be performed\r\nwhen the Robintron is on the surface of a planet and comes within the area of another planet's\r\ngravity well. The Robintron uses the other planet's gravity well to gain enough momentum to\r\nescape into space, and to land on the other planet's surface. Leaving a planet and subsequently\r\nlanding on another one takes no significant amount of time.Planet hopping has some disadvantages. The Robintron must be within the gravity well of a\r\nplanet other than the one it resides on, to be able to effectively use it for planet hopping. However,\r\nas the planets orbit around a star (which they all do in perfectly circular orbits), their position\r\ncontinuously changes according to their orbital speed. Thus, it can take up some time for the\r\nRobintron to enter the gravity well of a particular planet. Also, as soon as the Robintron chooses\r\nto enter the gravity well of a planet, it will move along with that planet around the star. Therefore,\r\nthis could mean that another planet's gravity well may never come in reach of the Robintron.Given a list of planets in a star system, a starting position and destination, write a program\r\nthat determines how many days it will take (using the ceiling function, i.e. ceiling(2.3) = 3) for\r\nthe Robintron to travel to its destination, given that it travels via the fastest route possible.Because in most star systems all planets are positioned around the star in a disc, only two\r\ndimensions have to be taken into account. Also, a planet is assumed to be a single point in space,\r\nand the Robintron's coordinates are equal to those of the planet it resides on.InputThe first line of input consists of the integer numbern, the number of test cases;Then, for each test case:A line containing the positive integer numberm(0 <m< 1000), the number of planets\r\nin the star system (excluding the star which always resides at position [0, 0]);Per planet a line containing 4 floating-point numbersx(-1e10 ≤x≤ 1e10) andy(-1e10 ≤y≤\r\n1e10), the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the planet relative to the star at the start of\r\nthe Robintron's journey respectively;r(0 <r≤ 1e5) the radius of the planet's gravity\r\nwell and s (0 ≤ s ≤ 2 × Pi) the speed, in radians per day, at which the planet orbits\r\n(counterclockwise) around the central star. The numbers are separated by a space.The Robintron's journey always starts at the first listed planet and its destination is always\r\nthe last listed planet, which is always reachable from the Robintron's starting position. The star\r\n(at position [0, 0]) is too hot for the Robintron and cannot be used for planet hopping.OutputFor each test case, the output consists of a line with one integer number: the number of days\r\n(rounded up, or 0 if the Robintron can reach its destination immediately) that the Robintron\r\nmust travel to reach its destination.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n10.0 0.0 1.0 1.570796325\r\n-13.0 0.0 3.1 3.14159265\r\n17.0 0.0 4.1 0.0\r\n5\r\n10.0 0.0 1.1 1.0\r\n12.0 0.0 1.1 2.0\r\n13.0 0.0 1.1 1.0\r\n0.0 11.0 1.1 3.14159265\r\n14.0 0.0 1.1 1.0Output:3\r\n7",
