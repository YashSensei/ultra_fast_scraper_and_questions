  "text": "In an algorithm lab class of Aiub there are N number of students  and personal computer. All of the computers are arranged in one row. Due to some reason some of the computer are not working properly so students who have  good computer are sharing their computer with their adjacent student means a student can only go to one step to his left or right.You know the number of properly working computer and their position. Print maximum number of student who can use computer.InputThe first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 60) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains integer n  (1 ≤  n ≤ 105) — the number of student and m  (1  ≤  m ≤  n) — properly working computer. The second line contains m integers bi(1  ≤  bi≤  n)  position of ith properly working computer.OutputPrint maximum number of student who can use computer.ExampleInput:2\r\n6 2\r\n2 5\r\n5 2\r\n2 5Output:Case 1: 6\r\nCase 2: 5",
