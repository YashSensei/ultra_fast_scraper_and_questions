  "text": "Flavius Josephus and 40 fellow rebels were trapped by the Romans.\r\nHis companions preferred suicide to surrender, so they decided to form a circle and to kill every third person and to proceed around the circle until no one was left.\r\nJosephus was not excited by the idea of killing himself, so he calculated the position to be the last man standing (and then he did not commit suicide since nobody could watch).We will consider a variant of this \"game\" where every second person leaves.\r\nAnd of course there will be more than 41 persons, for we now have computers.\r\nYou have to calculate the safe position.\r\nBe careful because we might apply your program to calculate the winner of this contest!Input SpecificationThe input contains several test cases.\r\nEach specifies a numbern, denoting the number of persons participating in the game.\r\nTo make things more difficult, it always has the format\"xyez\"with the following semantics: whennis written down in decimal notation, its first digit isx, its second digit isy, and then followzzeros.\r\nWhereas0<=x,y<=9, the number of zeros is0<=z<=6.\r\nYou may assume thatn>0.\r\nThe last test case is followed by the string00e0.Output SpecificationFor each test case generate a line containing the position of the person who survives.\r\nAssume that the participants have serial numbers from1tonand that the counting starts with person 1, i.e., the first person leaving is the one with number 2.\r\nFor example, if there are 5 persons in the circle, counting proceeds as2, 4, 1, 5and person3is staying alive.Sample Input05e0\r\n01e1\r\n42e0\r\n66e6\r\n00e0Sample Output3\r\n5\r\n21\r\n64891137",
