  "text": "Given n points in a plane find the diameter of the smallest circle that encloses all the points. A point lying on the circle is also considered to be inside it.InputFirst line of input contains the n (< 301) the number of points in the plane , followed by n lines of input. Each line gives the coordinates of one point on the plane. Each coordinate is an integer in the range [0, 1000]OutputOutput consists of a single real number, the diameter of the circle rounded to two decimal places.ExampleInput:4\r\n1 1\r\n1 0\r\n0 1\r\n0 0Output:1.41",
