  "text": "Tree is an important data structure in Computer\r\nScience. Of all trees we work with, Binary Tree is probably the most popular\r\none. A Binary Tree is called aStrictly Binary Treeif every nonleaf\r\nnode in a binary tree has nonempty left and right subtrees. Let us definea\r\nStrictly Binary Tree of depth d, as a Strictly Binary Tree that has at\r\nleast one root to leaf path of lengthd, and no root to leaf path in\r\nthat tree is longer thand. So let us use a similar reasoning to\r\ndefine a generalized structure.An n-ary Tree is called aStrictly n-ary Treeif every nonleaf node in an n-ary tree has n children each. AStrictly\r\nn-ary Tree of depth dcan now be defined as a Strictly n-ary Tree that\r\nhas at least one root to leaf path of length d, and no root to leaf path in\r\nthat tree is longer than d.Given the value of n and depth d, your task is to\r\nfind the number of different strictly n-ary trees of depth d.The figure below shows the 3 different strictly\r\nbinary trees of depth 2.InputInput consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two integersn (0 < n\r\n<= 32), d (0 <= d <= 16). Input is terminated a test case where\r\nn=0 and d=0, you must not process this test case.OutputFor each test\r\ncase, print three integers, n, d and the number of different strictly n-ary\r\ntrees of level d, in a single line. There will be a single space in between two\r\nintegers of a line. You can assume that you would not be asked about cases\r\nwhere you had to consider trees that may have more than 210nodes in\r\na level of the tree. You may also find it useful to know that the answer for\r\neach test case will always fit in a 200 digit integer.ExampleInput:2 0\r\n2 1\r\n2 2\r\n2 3\r\n3 5\r\n0 0Output:2 0 1\r\n2 1 1\r\n2 2 3\r\n2 3 21\r\n3 5 58871587162270592645034001",
