  "text": "ABHISHEK is weak of mathematics he is not able to solve the sequences frequently. So he invited topcoders to develop a program for solving the sequence. He managed to solve the other kind of sequences except one kind.The sequence description is as follows:(x-w)(x-w^2)(x-w^3)(x-w^4) ... (x-w^(n-1))where x is a number and w is nth root of unity.Inputfirst line contain number of test cases t. Then t line follow x and n. x and n separated by a space.Constraints:2 <= x <= 10002 <= n <= 1000t <= 410OutputPrint the result per test case according to above sequence and also keep in mind if there is any term in decimal then write it in form of a fraction. see the I/O for further detail.ExampleInput:1\r\n5 10Output:9765624/4Time limit is strict, so optimise your solution as you can. First try the tutorial version atCOMPLEX1",
