  "text": "A manufacturer of sweets has started production of a new type of \r\n\tsweet calledrock. Rock comes in sticks composed of  \r\n\tone-centimetre-long segments, some of which are sweet, and the rest are sour. \r\n\tBefore sale, the rock is broken up into smaller pieces by splitting it at the \r\n\tconnections of some segments.Today's children are very particular about what they eat, and they will only buy \r\n\ta piece of rock if it contains more sweet segments than sour ones. Try to \r\n\tdetermine the total length of rock which can be sold after breaking \r\n\tup the rock in the best possible way.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case, the first line of input contains one integer N - the length \r\n\tof the stick in centimetres (1<=N<=200). The next line is a sequence of N \r\n\tcharacters '0' or '1', describing the segments of the stick from the left end \r\n\tto the right end ('0' denotes a sour segment, '1' - a sweet one).OutputFor each test case output a line with a single integer: the total length of \r\n\trock that can be sold after breaking up the rock in the best possible way.ExampleSample input:2\r\n15\r\n100110001010001\r\n16\r\n0010111101100000Sample output:9\r\n13",
