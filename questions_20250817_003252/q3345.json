If the parameter is an index k, it is   guaranteed that 1 ≤ k ≤ 109.OutputFor each query, print the corresponding result in a single   line. In particular, for the queries K-TH, if k is larger than the   number of elements in S, print the word 'invalid'.ExampleInput8\nI -1\nI -1\nI 2\nC 0\nK 2\nD -1\nK 1\nK 2Output1\n2\n2\ninvalid",
