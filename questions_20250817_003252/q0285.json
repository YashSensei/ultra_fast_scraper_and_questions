  "text": "Your task is simple in this problem: count the number ofminimum spanning tree(Wikipedia) in a simple undirected graph. The number of minimum spanning trees mean in how many ways you can select a subset of the edges of the graphs which forms a minimum spanning tree.InputThe first line of input contains two integersN(1 ≤N≤ 100),M(1 ≤M≤ 1000). Nodes are labeled from 1 toN. In the followingMlines, every line contains three integersai,bi,ci, representing an undirected edge from nodeaito nodebi, with weightci. (1 ≤ai≠bi≤N, 1 ≤ci≤ 1,000,000,000). You can assume there is at most one edge between two nodes, and the graph described by input is connected.OutputPrint theanswer% 31011.ExampleInput:4 6\r\n1 2 1\r\n1 3 1\r\n1 4 1\r\n2 3 2\r\n2 4 1\r\n3 4 1Output:8",
