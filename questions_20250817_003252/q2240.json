  "text": "Mayhem has struck Arkham Asylum!Both Bane and Joker are running free in Arkham and rescuing other prisoners. The prison of Arkham consists ofNcells in a row. To decide who is superior, they play the following game: Both take turns alternately, and in each turn a player can open any one cell of the prison. They define a block of3consecutive open prison cells as a \"crime hole\". The first one to create a \"crime hole\" wins and is declared as the Ultimate Villain of Gotham. Joker plays first.As we know Bruce Wayne always keeps track of his enemies. In this situation he needs a program to decide who will emerge as the Ultimate Villain if both play optimally.InputFirst line of input contains number of Test Cases T, followed by T lines. On each line you are given a single integer N, depicting the number of prison cells.OutputFor each N, print \"Bane\" if Bane wins, else print \"Joker\". (Quotes for clarity)Constraints1 <=T<= 33333 <=N<= 3333ExampleInput:3\r\n3\r\n5\r\n6Output:Joker\r\nJoker\r\nBaneExplanationLet us denote the open cells by 'o' and closed cells by '-'.Case one:Initially all cells are closed(---), if Joker opens first cell configuration is (o--). Bane can either open second cell leading to configuration (oo-) or third cell (o-o). In both cases Joker wins on his next turn.Case two:Joker wins by opening the 3rd cell first i.e. configuration (--o--).",
