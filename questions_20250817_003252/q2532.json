  "text": "Rajesh Kuthrapali has a weird family structure. Every male member gives birth to a male child first and then a female child whereas every female member gives birth to a female child first and then to a male child. Rajesh analyses this pattern and wants to know what will be the Kth child in his Nth generation. Help him.Note:Every member has exactly 2 children.The generation starts with a male member (Rajesh).In the figure given below:M ------------ 1st generation\r\n                             /   \\\r\n                            /     \\\r\n                           /       \\\r\n                          M         F ------- 2nd generation\r\n                        /   \\     /   \\\r\n                       M     F   F     M\r\n                                 |\r\n                                3rd child of 3rd generationInputFirst line specifies T, the number of test cases.Next T lines each gives 2 numbers, N and K.OutputOutput 1 line for each test case giving the gender of the Kth child in in Nth generation.Print “Male” for male “Female” for female (quotes only for clarification).Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1001 ≤ N ≤ 100001 ≤ K ≤ min(1015, 2(n-1))ExampleInput:4\r\n1 1\r\n2 1\r\n2 2\r\n4 5Output:Male\r\nMale\r\nFemale\r\nFemale",
