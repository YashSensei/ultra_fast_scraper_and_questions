  "text": "You are given a sequence A consisting of N integers (not to be confused with the sequence from a previous\r\ntask). We will call the ithsequence element good if it equals the sum of some three elements in positions\r\nstrictly smaller than i (an element can be used more than once in the sum). How many good elements\r\ndoes the sequence contain?InputThe first line of input contains the positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5000), the length of the sequence A. The second line of input contains N space separated integers representing the sequence A (−100000 ≤ Ai≤ 100000).OutputThe first and only line of output must contain the number of good elements in the sequence.ExampleInput:2\r\n1 3Output:1Input:6\r\n1 2 3 5 7 10Output:4Input:3\r\n-1 2 0Output:1",
