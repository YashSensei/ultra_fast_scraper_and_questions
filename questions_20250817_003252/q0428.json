The serial number of 1stcard is 1, 2ndcard is 2 and so on. The serial numbers of the EID cards are written on it.Mahir came up with a great pricing idea. As they are looking to make much profit, the price of the EID cards are not fixed. They will fix according to their idea. So let’s describe it.Firstly, they will consider two things, the serial number of the card they are selling and the number of cards left before selling current card. And the price of this card will be product of this two.Let’s make it straight forward:Consider, they are sellingithcard. So the serial number isi.And so there will be actuallyn-i+1cards left before selling this card.So the price of the card will bei × (n-i+1).It is guaranteed that they will sell all the cards. Your task is to calculate the total income after selling all the cards.InputThe first line of the input contains an integerT(1   ≤   T   ≤  1,000). Each of the followingTlines will have an integerN (1   ≤   N   ≤  1,000,000,000).OutputFor each case, output a single line consisting of the total income of Mahir modulo1,000,000,007.ExampleInput:2510Output:35220",
