The rules for the special paths are noted below:A special path consists of some continuous edges (from the tree) and nodes.In a special path, the edges should be in opposite directions as they are in the tree.A node or an edge can be visited at most once in a special path.Multiple special paths may have common nodes or edges.For example, in the picture below, a tree is drawn, the black arrows represent the edges and their directions, circles represent nodes. Then we need two special paths. One path is2-1-0(green arrow), another is3-1(blue arrow). Instead of the path3-1we can add3-1-0. You cannot add a path like1-3or0-1-2because of rule 2. You cannot add0-2or2-3-0because of rule 1.InputInput starts with an integerT(≤ 30), denoting the number of test cases.Each case starts with a line containing an integerN(2 ≤N≤ 20000), whereNdenotes the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered from0toN-1. Each of the nextN-1lines contains two integersu v(0 ≤u,v<N,u≠v) meaning that there is an edge fromutov.OutputFor each case, print the case number and the minimum number of special paths required such that it's possible to go from any node to another.ExampleInput:2\r\n4\r\n0 1\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n5\r\n0 1\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n0 4Output:Case 1: 2\r\nCase 2: 3",
