  "text": "There is a building with flat square roof of size3k*3kand sides parallel to north-south and east-west directions. The\r\nroof is covered with square tiles of size1(with a side of length 1), but one of the tiles has been\r\nremoved and there is a hole in the roof (big enough to fall in). The tiles form a\r\nrectangular mesh on the roof, so their positions may be specified with\r\ncoordinates. The tile at the southwestern corner has coordinates (1,1). The\r\nfirst coordinate increases while going eastwards, and the second while going\r\nnorthwards.Sleepwalker wanders across the roof, in each step moving from the tile he is\r\nstanding on to the adjacent one on the east(E), west(W), south(S), or \r\nnorth(N). The\r\nsleepwalker roof ramble starts from the southwestern corner tile. The\r\ndescription of the path is a word dkbuilt of the lettersN, S, E, Wdenoting respectively a step to the north, south, east and west.

Generally, ifk>=1, the description of\r\na sleepwalker's path on the roof of dimension3k+1*3k+1is a word:dk+1=  a(dk) E a(dk) E dkN dkN dkW c(dk) S\r\nb(dk) W b(dk) N dkwhere functionsa,bandcdenote the following permutations of letters specifying directions:a: E->N W->S N->E S->W \r\nb: E->S W->N N->W S->E \r\nc: E->W W->E N->S S->NE.g. a(SEN)=WNE, b(SEN)=ESW, c(SEN)=NWS.We start observing sleepwalker at the time he stands on the tile of coordinates\r\n(u1, u2). After how many steps will sleepwalker fall into the hole made\r\nafter removing the tile of coordinates (v1, v2)?ExampleThere are sleepwalker's paths on roofs of dimension3*3and9*9on the\r\npicture below. In the second case, the point at which the observation starts and the hole have\r\nbeen marked. The sleepwalker has exactly20steps to the hole (from the\r\nmoment the observation starts).TaskWrite a program which:reads from the standard input integerkdenoting the size of the roof (3k*3k),\r\n  the position of the sleepwalker at the moment the observation starts and the position\r\n  of the hole,computes the number of steps that the sleepwalker will make before he falls into the\r\n  hole,writes the result to the standard output.InputThe number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.\r\nIn the first line of each test case one integerk,1<=k<=60, denoting the size of the roof (3k*3k) is written. In\r\neach of the following two lines of the test case  two natural\r\nnumbersx, yseparated with a space are written,1<=x<=3^k,1<=y<=3^k. The\r\nnumbers in the second line are the coordinates of the tile the sleepwalker is\r\nstanding on. The numbers in the third line are the coordinates of the hole. You\r\nmay assume, that with these data the sleepwalker will eventually fall into the hole\r\nafter some number of steps.OutputThe only line of output for each test case should contain the number of steps on\r\nthe sleepwalker's path to the hole.ExampleSample input:1\r\n2\r\n3 2\r\n7 2Sample output20",
