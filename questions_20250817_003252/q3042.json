  "text": "Ada the Ladybug likes numbers. Her friends know it so they wanted to give her a number as a gift. Sadly, they bought the number in IKEA so Ada has to assemble the number by herself. Now she is in following situation - she has a few digits before herself and she is wondering what number she will create. As she doesn't understand the manual (it is in Swedish) she has possibility to assemble anything.She is not sure yet, anyway her favourite options are to assemble number with the most divisors or the number with the biggest sum of divisors. Can you help her to find such?NOTE:To assemble number from digits, simply choose any permutation of digits. Leading zeroes are perfectly OKbutyou have to use all the digits.InputThe first line of each test-case will contain an integer1 ≤ N ≤     9, the number of digits to assemble.The next line will containNdigits0 ≤ di≤ 9.OutputOutput two integers - the number with the most divisors AND the number with biggest sum of divisors. In case there are multiple such numbers, choose the lesser one. As long as you would use leading zeroes, output the number without the leading zeroes.Example Input1\r\n5Example Output5 5Example Input3\r\n1 1 0Example Output110 110Example Input2\r\n3 4Example Output34 34Example Input5\r\n1 2 3 4 5Example Output43512 51324Example Input6\r\n2 2 3 3 4 4Example Output432432 432432Example Input3\r\n4 8 2Example Output248 824Example Input4\r\n1 3 5 7Example Output7315 7315Example Input7\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7Example Output3124576 7516432",
