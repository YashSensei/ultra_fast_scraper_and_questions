  "text": "Substrings are consecutive parts of a string. A problem usually solved with dynamic programming is to find the longest common substring problem is to find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two strings.Your task is to find the length of the longest common substring of K strings.InputThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 20) . Each test case, consists of one line containing an integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 10), and K lines, each containing a string (length of s ≤ 104), the strings only contain the character ‘a’ – ‘z’.OutputOutput T lines, one for each test case, containing the required sequence, with a blank space between consecutive terms. It is guaranteed that all terms in the sequence are integers.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\naaabbb\r\nbbaabb\r\n3\r\nicode\r\ncoder\r\ncontestOutput:4\r\n2",
