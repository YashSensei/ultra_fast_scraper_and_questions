  "text": "It's the year 4224 and Giant Machine Corporation has started working on its 42nd Generation Robots. These robots are designed to have peculiar specifications.The company hasNdifferent parts (numbered from1 to N), each of which impart a very specific property to the robot. The formation of a single robotRconsists ofMsteps. At theithstep, one of theNparts is chosen and added to the current robot. After theMthstep, the robot is ready. Letnum(i, j)be the count of part numberjuntil theithstep used for making the robotR.The 41st Generation Robots were found to be defective in the sense that one of their properties overshadowed their other properties significantly. Hence, for the 42nd Generation, it was decided that for any robotR,|num(i, j) – num(i, k)| ≤ 2for every1 ≤ i ≤ Mand for every pair ofj, kwhere1 ≤ j, k ≤ N.Now, the Giant Machine Corporation is interested to know the number of different 42nd Generation Robots that they can make which satisfy the above criteria and hence they have hired you for the task. Since, this number can be very large, output the result modulo109+ 7.Note: Two robotsR1andR2are considered different, if a different part is used in any of the correspondingisteps out ofMsteps.InputThe first line starts with an integerT, denoting the number of test cases.Tlines follow with each line consisting of two space separated integersMandN.OutputFor each test case, print in a single line the required number.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 201 ≤ N ≤ 501 ≤ M ≤ 1018ExampleInput:3\r\n1 1\r\n2 2\r\n3 2Output:1\r\n4\r\n6Problem Setter: Vivek Hamirwasia.",
