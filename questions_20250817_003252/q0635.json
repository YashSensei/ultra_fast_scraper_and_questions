  "text": "Hareedi and Hanadt live in a village withNhouses built next to each other along one\r\nstraight roadway with equal distances between adjacent houses. Some people own cows\r\nand sell the milk their cows produce, while others do not own cows and may need to buy\r\nmilk.Every morning, Hareedi and Hanadi transport milk around the village such that everyone\r\nbuys or sells the exact number of bottles they want. Transporting one bottle of milk from\r\none house to an adjacent house results in one unit of work.Fortunately, the number of\r\nmilk bottles needed by people is always equal to the number of milk bottles sold by\r\ncow owners.Taskwrite a program that is given the number of milk bottles that people at each house needs\r\nto buy or sell, represented as an integer, finds the minimum work necessary to transport\r\nthe bottles from sellers to buyers.Constraints2 ≤N≤ 1,000,000 - the number of houses.-1000 ≤Bi≤ 1000 - an integer representing the number of bottles to be bought from or sold at the house at positioni.There are 28 test cases.InputLine 1 contains the integerN, the number of houses.Each of the nextNlines contains an integerBi. IfBi> 0 then people in house i are cow owners and want to sellBibottles of milk. IfBi≤ 0 then people at house i are not cow owners\r\nand want to buyBibottles of milk.OutputA single line containing a single integer, the minimum work units necessary to transport the bottle of milk.ExampleInput:5\r\n5\r\n-4\r\n1\r\n-3\r\n1Output:9ExplanationThere are 5 houses as shown in the table.Position12345Bottles5-41-314 bottles are transported from house 1 to house 2, 1 bottle from house 1 to\r\nhouse 4, 1 bottle from house 3 to house 4, 1 bottle from house 5 to house 4.",
