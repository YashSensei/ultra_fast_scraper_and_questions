  "text": "You are given a tree (an undirected acyclic connected graph) withNnodes, and edges numbered 1, 2, 3 ...N-1. Each edge has an integer value assigned to it, representing its length.We will ask you to perform some instructions of the following form:DIST a b: ask for the distance between nodeaand nodeborKTH a b k: ask for thek-th node on the path from nodeato nodebExample:N= 61 2 1 // edge connects node 1 and node 2 has cost 12 4 12 5 21 3 13 6 2Path from node 4 to node 6 is 4 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 6DIST 4 6: answer is 5 (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5)KTH 4 6 4: answer is 3 (the 4-th node on the path from node 4 to node 6 is 3)InputThe first line of input contains an integert, the number of test cases (t<= 25).ttest cases follow.For each test case:In the first line there is an integerN(N<= 10000)In the nextN-1 lines, the i-th line describes the i-th edge: a line with three integersa b cdenotes an edge betweena,bof costc(c<= 100000)The next lines contain instructions\"DIST a b\"or\"KTH a b k\"The end of each test case is signified by the string \"DONE\".There is one blank line between successive tests.OutputFor each\"DIST\"or\"KTH\"operation, write one integer representing its result.Print one blank line after each test.ExampleInput:1\r\n\r\n6\r\n1 2 1\r\n2 4 1\r\n2 5 2\r\n1 3 1\r\n3 6 2\r\nDIST 4 6\r\nKTH 4 6 4\r\nDONEOutput:5\r\n3",
