Now you want to find the sum of all those integers which can be expressed as the sum of at least one subset of the given array.InputFirst line contains T the number of test case. then T test cases follow, first line of each test case contains N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) the number of integers, next line contains N integers, each of them is between 0 and 1000 (inclusive).OutputFor each test case print the answer in a new line.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n0 1\r\n3\r\n2 3 2Output:1\r\n21",
