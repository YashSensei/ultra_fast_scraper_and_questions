  "text": "Suppose we want to replicate a file over a collection of n servers, labeledS1,S2...Sn. To place a copy of the file at serverSiresults in a placement cost ofci, for an integerci> 0. Now, if a user requests the file from serverSi, and no copy of the file is present atSi, then the serversSi + 1,Si + 2,Si + 3... are searched in order until a copy of the file is finally found, say at serverSj, wherej>i. This results in an access cost ofj−i. (Note that the lower-indexed serversSi−1,Si−2, ... are not consulted in this search.) The access cost is 0 ifSiholds a copy of the file. We will require that a copy of the file be placed at serverSn, so that all such searches will terminate, at the latest, atSn.We’d like to place copies of the files at the servers so as to minimize the sum of placement and access costs. Formally, we say that a configuration is a choice, for each serverSiwithi= 1, 2 ...n−1, of whether to place a copy of the file atSior not. (Recall that a copy is always placed atSn.) The total cost of a configuration is the sum of all placement costs for servers with a copy of the file, plus the sum of all access costs associated with allnservers.Write a program which reads from the standard input the placement costs and writes a single number, the minimum cost of a configuration. First line of the input consists of the numbernof servers (1 ≤n≤ 1000). In the nextnlines you are given the placement costs, in linei+ 1 you are given the placement costciof serverSi.ExampleInput:4\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n9Output:12Input:4\r\n4\r\n3\r\n2\r\n1Output:6",
