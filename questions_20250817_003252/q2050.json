Can you find the maximum girth a graph withN-vertices and (N+1) edges could possibly have?Since the answer could be large output the answer modulo 109+7.InputThe first line contains single integerT- the number of test cases. Each of the nextTlines contains a single integerN.OutputFor every test case output the maximum girth (modulo 109+7) in a separate line.ExampleInput:3\r\n45\r\n3434\r\n5656565Output:30\r\n2290\r\n3771044Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 10001 ≤ N ≤ 1018",
