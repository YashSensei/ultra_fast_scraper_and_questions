  "text": "You are given a cyclic array A having N numbers. In an AND round, each element of the array A is replaced by the bitwise AND of itself, the previous element, and the next element in the array. All operations take place simultaneously. Can you calculate A after K such AND rounds?InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T (T ≤ 50).There follow 2T lines, 2 per test case. The first line contains two space separated integers N (3 ≤ N ≤ 20000) and K (1 ≤ K ≤ 1000000000). The next line contains N space separated integers Ai (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000), which are the initial values of the elements in array A.OutputOutput T lines, one per test case. For each test case, output a space separated list of N integers, specifying the contents of array A after K AND rounds.ExampleInput:2 \r\n3 1 \r\n1 2 3 \r\n5 100 \r\n1 11 111 1111 11111Output:0 0 0 \r\n1 1 1 1 1",
