  "text": "NOTICE: The test cases for this problem are not as hard as intended. If you've solved this problem, and think your solution is up for it, tryVFRIEND2!You are creating a new soical network for dogs. Wow. The dogs don't have many possibilities for interacting with your website, but they can bark how many friends they want. E.g. if a dog wants to have much 8 friends it will bark 8 times, and if it doesn't want any friends, it'll just stay quiet.After spending a good year of your life collecting these barks, you are finally ready to assign a friend list for each dog. The only problem is: You are not sure whether it is actually possible. Thus before you proceed you would like to write a program, that given a list ofNwisheswi, outputsHAPPYif it is possible to make a friend list for each dogiof lengthwi, orSADif some dog will have to get more or fewer friends than it wished for.Notice: Being friends is considered an irreflexive, symetric relation.Update: If you manage to solve this problem much efficiently, have a look at VFRIEND2, which is a so harder version of this problem.InputThe first line will contain a single integerT- the number of test cases to process.Each following lines will start with an integer0 ≤ N ≤ 105followed by an ordered list ofNwishes0 ≤ wi≤ 105.OutputWrite the answer -HAPPYorSAD- for each test case on a separate line.ExampleInput:33 0 1 15 0 1 2 3 46 1 1 2 2 3 3Output:HAPPYSADHAPPYExplanationIn the first case we can make dog 2 and 3 be friends.In the second case no assignment that works, since dog 5 would have to be friends with everyone, but dog 1 doesn't want that.",
