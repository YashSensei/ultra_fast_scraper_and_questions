  "text": "A genetic codeof the abstract primitivus (Primitivus recurencis) is a series of natural numbersK =(a1... an).A featureof primitivus we call each ordered pair of numbers\r\n(l,r), which appears successively in the genetic code, i.e. there exists suchithatl=ai, r=ai+1. There are no (p,p) features in a primitivus' genetic\r\ncode.TaskWrite a program which:reads the list of the features from the standard input,computes the length of the shortest genetic code having given features,writes the results to the standard output.InputThe number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.\r\nIn the first line of each test case one positive integer numbernis written. It is the number of different features of the primitivus. In each\r\nof the followingnlines there is a pair of natural numberslandrseparated\r\nby a single space,1 ≤ l ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ r ≤ 1000. A pair (l,r) is one of the primitivus' features. The features do not repeat in the input fileOutputYour program should write for each test case\r\nexactly one integer number equal to the length of the shortest\r\ngenetic code of the primitivus, comprising the features from the input.ExampleSample input:1\r\n12\r\n2 3\r\n3 9\r\n9 6\r\n8 5\r\n5 7\r\n7 6\r\n4 5\r\n5 1\r\n1 4\r\n4 2\r\n2 8\r\n8 6Sample output:15All the features from the example are written in the following genetic code:(8, 5, 1, 4, 2, 3, 9, 6, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 8, 6)Warning: enormous Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
