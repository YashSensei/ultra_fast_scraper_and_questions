  "text": "You are given N integers, A[1] to A[N]. You have to assign weights to  these integers such that their weighted sum is maximized. The weights  should satisfy the following conditions :Each weight should be a positive integer.W[1] = 1W[i] should be in the range [2, W[i-1] + 1] for i > 1Weighted sum is defined as S = A[1] × W[1] + A[2] × W[2] + ... + A[N] × W[N]InputThere are multiple test cases.First line contains the number of test casesEach test case consists of a single line containing N.This is followed by N lines, each containing A[i]OutputFor each test case, output one line - the maximum weighted sum.ExampleInput:14123-4Output:6ExplanationThe weights are 1, 2, 3, 2.ConstraintsN ≤ 106| A[i] | ≤ 106Total number of test cases is around 10.",
