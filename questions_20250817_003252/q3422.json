  "text": "Cool numbers are those, whose digits can be partitioned into two sets such that the sum of the digits in either sets are equal.Example: 23450 is cool because 3+4+0 = 2+5; So is 91125;The numbers 567, 34523 are not cool, since there is no such digit partition.Write a program that prints the number of cool numbers in the inclusive range [A,B].Input Format:The input file consists of multiple testcases.Each case contains one line containing two 32-bit unsigned integers A and B. (1 <= A <= B <= 4*109).Input terminates with a line containing two zeros and must not be processed.Output Format:For each testcase print a single line containing one integer saying the number of cool numbers between A and B, inclusive.Sample Input:1 11\r\n12 20\r\n1 20\r\n3 100\r\n6354 234363\r\n123456789 234567891\r\n0 0Sample Output:1\r\n0\r\n1\r\n9\r\n82340\r\n54801678Test Data:About 50 testcases.",
