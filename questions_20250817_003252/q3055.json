  "text": "Ada the Ladybug was playingchessagainst her good friend Velvet Mite Vinit. They came up with new figure, calledpalace. In fact, palace is justtowerwithkinginside. It can attack as king and tower combined: Either anywhere to same column or roworanywhere to adjacent (by side or diagonal) field.Their question is simple: How many ways canNpalaces be placed onN×Nchessboard so none of them attacks any other. Since this number might be pretty big, output answer modulo109+7InputThe first line of input will contain1 ≤ T ≤ 105, the number of test-cases.Each of the testcases will contain single integer1 ≤ N ≤ 107, the size of chessboard.OutputFor each test-case output the number of possibilities modulo 1000000007.Example Input8\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n7\r\n10\r\n1000\r\n10000\r\n9999999Example Output1\r\n0\r\n0\r\n646\r\n479306\r\n711794305\r\n450342414\r\n838796194",
