  "text": "Balanced numbers have been used by mathematicians for centuries. A positive integer is considered a balanced number if:Everyevendigit appears anoddnumber of times in its decimal representation.Everyodddigit appears anevennumber of times in its decimal representation.For example, 77, 211, 6222 and 112334445555677 are balanced numbers while 351, 21, and 662 are not.Given an interval [A, B], your task is to find the amount of balanced numbers in [A, B] where bothA and B are included.InputThe first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases.A test case consists of two numbers A and B separated by a single space representing the interval. You may assume that 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1019OutputFor each test case, you need to write a number in a single line: the amount of balanced numbers in the corresponding intervalExampleInput:2\r\n1 1000\r\n1 9Output:147\r\n4",
