  "text": "T.E. Lawrence, popularized by the movieLawrence of Arabia, was a British officer during World War I. He is best known for disrupting the railroads of the Ottoman Empire.For this problem, the railroad of concern runs uninterrupted without branches through several outposts.P ----- P ----- P ----- PEach outpost has a value. The strategic value of a group of connected outposts is the sum of the pairwise products of the outposts. A single outpostahas no strategic value; two connected outpostsaandbhave strategic valuea*b; three connected outputsa,b, andchave stategic valuea*b + a*c + b*c; and so on.The total stategic value of the railroad is the sum of the strategic values of these connected groupsLawrence can attack and destroy a certain number of railroad segments. His goal is to reduce the strategic value of the railroad as much as possible.For example, consider the following railroad4 ----- 5 ----- 1 ----- 2The stategic value is 4*5 + 4*1 + 4*2 + 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2, or 49.Suppose Lawrence has one attack, which is marked by an x.He could attack the left segment.4   x   5 ----- 1 ----- 2The left group has no value, and the right group has value 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2, for a total of 17.Or he could attack the middle segment.4 ----- 5   x   1 ----- 2The left group has value 4*5, and the right group has value 1*2, for a total of 22.Or he could attack the right segment.4 ----- 5 ----- 1   x   2The left group has value 4*5 + 4*1 + 5*1, and the right group has no value, for a total of 29.In this case, it would be best for Lawrence to attack the left segment.InputThe first line is the number of outposts, 0 < P <= 500.The second line is the number of railroad segments Lawrence can destroy, 0 <= N < P.The third line is the space-separated values of the S outposts. Each value is an integer from 0 to 20, inclusive.OutputThe minimum possible stategic value of the railroad after Lawrence's attack.SampleInput 14\r\n1\r\n4 5 1 2Output 117Input 24\r\n2\r\n4 5 1 2Output 22",
