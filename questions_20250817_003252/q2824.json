  "text": "Changu likes to play with string and subsequences. He has thought of a puzzle for you. Can you answer him?He gives you a sequence of '(' and ')'. Your task is to find out the number of itsdifferent subsequencesthat are regular bracket sequences.For example, the sequence “()()” has 3 such subsequences: “()()”, “()”, and “”. As the number can be large, you have to output answer modulus 1000000007.InputThe first line contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each containing a sequence of '(' and ')'.OutputFor each test case, print the required answer.SampleInput2\r\n()\r\n()()Output:2\r\n3ConstraintsT < 100 < |S| <= 1000",
