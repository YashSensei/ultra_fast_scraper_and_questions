Can you help her by writing a program for her that could do the specified taskInputThe first line contains T (≤ 1000) test cases. The next T lines each contain one integer N (≤ 1015) for which you need to find the Nth member of the list.OutputOutput T lines each containing the required answer.ExampleInput:3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3Output:1\r\n10\r\n100",
