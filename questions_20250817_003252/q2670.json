  "text": "PROBLEM DPLAYING WITH MARBLESPablo was assigned in his class to construct pentagons inside pentagons with marbles but he doesnâ€™t know how many marbles he will need. He knows that for one pentagon he needs 5 marblesThe only way he knows to insert a second pentagon is putting a marble in the middle of each segment and drawing three lines as shown. He puts a marble in the intersecting lines and removes them. To insert a third pentagon inside he first divides all segments in two including the ones that are not needed, and repeats the procedure. Drawing a second pentagon will require 12 marbles. A third pentagon will require 22 marbles. Given the information of how many pentagons will be created, write a program to calculate the number of marbles needed.InputThe input contains several test cases. Each test case contains one integer N indicating the number of pentagons to create (1<=N<=103). The end of input is indicated by a line containing only one zero.OutputFor each test case in the input, your program must print a single line, containing one single integer, the number of marbles required.Sample Input1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n0Sample Output5\r\n12\r\n22",
