You need to output the sum of the first 1000 decimal places of the square-root of the number (ignore the integral part).For example-if the given number is 2. The square-root of 2 is 1.4142135623..... So, ignore the number before decimal (1 in this case) and add the first 1000 digits after decimal and output them as result. (4482 in this case.NOTE: If the number is a perfect square, the output should be 0.Inputthe first line of input consist of t (the number of test cases).t lines follow-Each line consist of a non-negative integer n.OutputOutput in separate lines the result corresponding to integer n.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 1001 ≤ n ≤ 100000ExampleInput:2\r\n4\r\n2Output:0\r\n4482",
