  "text": "The statement of this problem is very simple. Given two number n and k, you need to find the maximum power of k (i.e. x) such that n! % kx= 0. Here n! is the notation of n factorial. If you are not familiar with the notation,n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 ... * nInputFirst line of the input will contain an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) denoting the number of test case. The next t lines contain two integer number n and k as described above.ConstraintsFor easy version, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10For harder version, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100000000OutputFor each test case, print “Case t: x” where t is the test case number and x is the maximum power of k for which n! % kx= 0.ExampleInput:2\r\n5 2\r\n1000 2Output:Case 1: 3\r\nCase 2: 994ExplanationIn the first test case, n = 5 and k = 2. So, n! = 120.120 % 20= 0120 % 21= 0120 % 22= 0120 % 23= 0120 % 24= 8120 % 25= 24120 % 26= 56120 % 27= 120So, the answer should be 3.Problem Setter: Rakibul Islam",
