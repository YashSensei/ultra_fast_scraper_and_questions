  "text": "Bessie the cow used to write musical melody. A musical melody is\r\nrepresented as a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) notes numbered 1..N.\r\nNote i is  represented by the integer Ai(-10,000 ≤ Ai≤ 10,000).To Bessie's cow-like mind, a musical melody is called 'perfect' if and only\r\nif the sum of all the notes in any of its consecutive subsequences is\r\nstrictly positive.For a given musical melody, Bessie wants to make it perfect, but she wants\r\nto change the melody as little as possible.Thus, to perfect the melody, she repeatedly chooses a consecutive\r\nsubsequence of the melody, [x, y] (1 < x ≤ y < N), whose sum S is\r\nnegative. Then she adds S to both Ax-1and Ay+1, while subtracting S from\r\nboth Axand Ay. (It is possible to subtract from the same note twice if x\r\n= y.)Given a musical melody, compute the minimum number of steps to make the\r\nmelody perfect.InputLine 1: The single integer N.Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the single integer Ai.OutputLine 1: A single integer that represents the minimum number of steps\r\n        needed to make the given musical melody perfect. If there are\r\n        no solutions, output -1 instead.ExampleInput:5\r\n13\r\n-3\r\n-4\r\n-5\r\n62Output:2ExplanationThere is a musical melody with length of 5. The notes are (13, -3, -4, -5, 62).First, we choose the range [2, 4]; its sum is (-3) + (-4) + (-5) = -12.\r\nAfter the first step, the melody becomes (1, 9, -4, 7, 50). Second, we\r\nchoose the range [3, 3], whose sum is -4, and the melody after the second\r\nstep becomes (1, 5, 4, 3, 50). The melody is perfect now.Warning: large input/output data, be careful with certain languages",
