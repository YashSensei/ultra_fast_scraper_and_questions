  "text": "RKhas received a homework assignment to compute thegreatest common divisorof the two positive integersAandB. Since the numbers are quite large, the professor provided him withNsmaller integers whose product isA, andMintegers with productB.RK would like to verify his result, so he has asked you to write a program to solve his problem. If the result is more than 9 digits long, output only thelast 9digits.InputThe first line of input contains the positive integerN(1 ≤N≤ 1000).The second line of input containsNspace-separated positive integers less than 109, whose product is the numberA.The third line of input contains the positive integerM(1 ≤M≤ 1000).The fourth line of input containsMspace-separated positive integers less than 109, whose product is the numberB.OutputThe first and only line of output must contain the greatest common divisor of numbersAandB. If the result is more than 9 digits long, output only the last (least significant) 9 digits.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 3 5\r\n2\r\n4 5Output:10Input:3\r\n358572 83391967 82\r\n3\r\n50229961 1091444 8863Output:000012028First sample description: The greatest common divisor of numbers A = 30 and B = 20 equals 10.",
