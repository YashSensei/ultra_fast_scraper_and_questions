  "text": "60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 5. No smaller number than 60 has this property.InputOn the first line, you will be given two integersT(the number of test cases), andM(an integer).Each of the nextTlines contains an integerN.OutputFor each test case, output on one line, the smallest number that is divisible\r\nby all integers from 1 toN(inclusive).\r\n\r\nAs the answer may be a big number, output it moduloM.ExampleInput:1 1000000007\r\n5Output:60ConstraintsT ≤ 105108≤ M ≤ 2×109, a prime number0 < N < 108InformationThere's one easy input file, and several harder ones. Time limit allows unoptimized code with fast languages to get AC ; for slower languages it may be hard.Good luck and have fun ;-)Edit(2017-02-11) : New time limit (after compiler changes).",
