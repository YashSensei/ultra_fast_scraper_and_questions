  "text": "We are given a sequence a1 ... an. We can manipulate this sequence using the operation reduce(i), which replaces elements ai and ai+1 with a single element max(ai, ai+1), resulting in a new shorter sequence. The cost of this operation is max(ai, ai+1). After n−1 operations reduce, we obtain a sequence of length 1. Our task is to compute the cost of the optimal reducing scheme, i.e. the sequence of reduce operations with minimal cost leading to a sequence of length 1.InputThe first line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000,000), the length of the sequence. The following n lines contain one integer ai, the elements of the sequence (0 ≤ ai ≤ 1,000,000,000).OutputIn the first and only line of the output print the minimal cost of reducing the sequence to a single element.ExampleInput:3123Output:5",
