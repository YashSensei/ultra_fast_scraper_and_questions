  "text": "EnglishVietnameseMirko has decided to rob mini-safe owned by his son so that he could\ntake away some football stickers which are missing in his big sticker \ncollection.Lock on the safe consists of N equal discs, each of them being divided\nin 10,000,000 equal segments numbered from 1 to 10,000,000 \nclockwise. In the begining, segments on discs having the same number \nare placed one above (beneath) the other. Discs are layed one on the \nother such that the segments are overlaping and each disc is missing \nexactly one segment that is called hole. \nIn order to unlock the lock, all holes must be one above (beneath) the other. \nIn  one second, Mirko can turn one disc in  one direction (clockwise or \ncounterclockwise) for  one segment.Write a program which will find the minimal time that Mirko needs to\nopen the safe.InputThe first line of the input file contains an integer N, 2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000, \nthe number of discs.The next N lines contain data describing the initial positions of \nthe holes on each disc.  \nThe (i + 1)-th line contains an integer Pi, 1 ≤ Pi\n ≤ 10000000, \nthe initial position of the hole on the i-th disc.OutputThe first and only line of the output file should contain the minimal time \n(in seconds). \nNote: take care of the size of that number.Samplesafe.in \n \n3 \n5 \n17 \n7 \n \nsafe.out \n \n12 \n\nsafe.in \n \n4 \n9999999 \n7 \n16 \n9999995 \n \nsafe.out \n \n29\n\nsafe.in \n \n4 \n1 \n2500001 \n5000000 \n7500002 \n \nsafe.out \n \n9999998",
