  "text": "Let us see the following equation,ax + by = cGiven three positive integersa,bandc. You have to determine whether there exists at least one solution for some integers value ofxandywherex,ymay be negative or non-negative integers.For example ifa = 2,b = 4andc = 8then the equation will be2x + 4y = 8, and hence, forx = 2andy = 1, there exists a solution.Let us see another example fora = 3,b = 6andc = 7, so the equation will become3x + 6y = 7and there exists no solution satisfying this equation.InputInput starts with an integerT (1 ≤ T ≤ 105)denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integersa,b, andc.(1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 106).OutputFor each test case of input print the case number and “Yes” if there exists at least one solution, print “No” otherwise.ExampleSample   InputSample Output22 4 83 6 7Case 1:   YesCase 2: NoProblem Setter: Md Abdul Alim, Dept. of Computer Science, Bangladesh University of Business & Technology",
