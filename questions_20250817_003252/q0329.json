  "text": "Given two sequences of words: X = (x1... xn) and Y = (y1... yn), determine how many binary sequences P = (p1... pn) exist, such \r\nthat the word concatenation z1z2...zn, where zi= xiiff pi= 1 and zi= yiiff pi= 0,\r\nis a palindrome (a word which is the same when read from left to right and from \r\nright to left).InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\ncases follow.For each test case the first line contains the positive integer n - the number \r\nof words in a sequence (1 ≤ n ≤ 30). The following n lines contain \r\nconsecutive words of the sequence X, one word per line. The next n lines \r\ncontain consecutive words of the sequence Y, one word per line. Words consist \r\nof lower case letters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z'), are non-empty, and not \r\nlonger than 400 characters.OutputFor each test case output one line containing a single integer - the number of \r\ndifferent possible sequences P.ExampleSample input:1\r\n5\r\nab\r\na\r\na\r\nab\r\na\r\na\r\nbaaaa\r\na\r\na\r\nbaSample output:12",
