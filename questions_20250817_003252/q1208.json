Each query has one of two formats:Format 0 l r k: you need to output the k-th smallest positive integer that can’t be partition into a sum of any subsequence of al... ar.Format 1 l r x: you need to output the numbers of ways to partition x into a sum of a subseqence of al... ar(or the numbers of subsequence that sum of all its elements equal to x) (modulo 232).InputFirst line: two positive n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10000)Second line: n positive a1…an­(0 ≤ ai≤ 100)Next q lines: each line denotes a query with one of two format listed above (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 109, 0 ≤ x ≤ 109)Outputq lines: the i-th line is the answer of i-th query.SampleInput:5 3\r\n1 0 2 4 1\r\n0 2 3 2\r\n1 1 4 0\r\n1 2 5 3Output:3\r\n1\r\n2",
