  "text": "Ada the Ladybug grows a mulberrytree(which is rooted at node 0). At the beginning, it has a mulberry fruit of distinct size growing on every node. As the time flows, new mulberry fruits appear on each node (additionally - meaning the previous mulberry fruit still remains on given node) - while keeping the condition of distinct sizes.Ada observes every single fruit and for each new fruit she is asking you to tell her the number of lesser fruits in the subtree of given node.InputThe first line contains two integers1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2×105, size of mulberry tree.The next line containsNintegers:0 ≤ Ai≤ 106, the size of mulberry fruit in each node.Each of the nextN-1lines contains two integers0 ≤ a, b < N, meaning the branch (edge) between given nodes.Each of the nextQlines contains two integersa S:0 ≤     a < N(the node in which new fruit grows) and0 ≤ S ≤     106(size of the fruit)OutputFor each query, print the number of lesser mulberry fruits which grow in subtree of node where new mulberry fruit grew.Example Input7 8\r\n10 9 13 17 11 20 18\r\n0 4\r\n0 1\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 5\r\n2 6\r\n0 21\r\n0 8\r\n2 15\r\n3 22\r\n1 14\r\n2 19\r\n0 12\r\n1 16Example Output7\r\n0\r\n1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n4",
