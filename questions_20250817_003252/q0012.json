  "text": "This man has grown so rich that, when he travels between any\r\ntwo locations he always takes at least K flights. In a region of N\r\ncities, we need to find the minimal cost required for the man to travel\r\nbetween every pair of cities. There are provisions (especially for this\r\ntype of rich men,) to fly from i-th city to the i-th city itself!InputT – The number of test cases.In each test case:K NN×N matrix representing the costs of the tickets. The i-th line, j-th\r\ncolumn’s entry represents the cost of a ticket from city i to city j.\r\nThe numbers are of course space separated.ConstraintsT ≤ 20N ≤ 50K ≤ 109The cost of each ticket  ≤  100Each element of the output matrix will fit into a \r\n  64-bit integer.OutputFor the i-th test case, 1st line is of the form “Region #i:”.In the following N lines, output an N×N matrix where the j-th element\r\nof the i-th line represents the minimal cost to travel from city i to\r\ncity j with taking at least K flights. The numbers on a line must be\r\nseparated by at least one space. Output a blank line after each test case\r\n(including the last one).ExampleInput:2\r\n3 4\r\n1 2 3 4\r\n5 6 7 8\r\n9 10 11 12\r\n13 14 15 16\r\n10999 4\r\n1 2 3 4\r\n5 6 7 8\r\n9 10 11 12\r\n13 14 15 16Output:Region #1:\r\n3 4 5 6\r\n7 8 9 10\r\n11 12 13 14\r\n15 16 17 18\r\n\r\nRegion #2:\r\n10999 11000 11001 11002\r\n11003 11004 11005 11006\r\n11007 11008 11009 11010\r\n11011 11012 11013 11014",
