  "text": "The problem description is the same as the problemDRAGON.InputThe first line contains 3 integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 3000), M (2 ≤ M ≤ N), K (1 ≤ K ≤ N), separated by single spaces. The N fruits are numbered 1..N, and the biggest fruit is always numbered 1. N-1 lines follow, each contains 3 integers i, j, k separated by spaces denoted that there is a branch between fruit i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) and fruit j (1 ≤ j ≤ N) and the weight of illness of this branch is k (0 ≤ k ≤ 100000).OutputOutput one line contains a single integer denoted the minimum weight of illness of the hydra. If we can't divide the fruit into M groups, output \"-1\" (without quotes).ExampleInput:8 2 4\r\n1 2 20\r\n1 3 4 \r\n1 4 13\r\n2 5 10\r\n2 6 12\r\n3 7 15\r\n3 8 5Output:4Some new test cases were added.",
