  "text": "A number isAlmost-K-Primeif it has exactlyKprime numbers (not necessarily distinct) in its prime factorization. For example, 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 is an Almost-3-Prime and 32 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 is an Almost-5-Prime number. A numberXis calledAlmost-K-First-P-Primeif it satisfies the following criterions:X is an Almost-K-Prime andX hasall and onlythe first P (P ≤ K) primes in its prime factorization.For example, if K=3 and P=2, the numbers 18 = 2 * 3 * 3 and 12 = 2 * 2 * 3 satisfy the above criterions. And 630 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 7 is an example of Almost-5-First-4-Prime.For a given K and P, your task is to calculate the summation ofΦ(X)for all integers X such that X is an Almost-K-First-P-Prime.In mathematicsΦ(X)means the number of relatively prime numbers with respect to X which are smaller than X. Two numbers are relatively prime if their GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) is 1. For example, Φ(12) = 4, because the numbers that are relatively prime to 12 are: 1, 5, 7, 11.InputInput starts with an integerT (≤ 10000), denoting the number of test cases.Each case starts with a line containing two integersK (1 ≤ K ≤ 500)andP (1 ≤ P ≤ K).OutputFor each case, print the case number and the result modulo1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 2\r\n5 4\r\n99 45Output:Case 1: 10\r\nCase 2: 816\r\nCase 3: 49939643",
