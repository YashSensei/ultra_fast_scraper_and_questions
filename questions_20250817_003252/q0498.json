  "text": "Given a non-negative integerX. Calculate the smallest non-negative integerY, such thatY≤X, and the length of the longest common subsequence (not necessarily continuous) ofstring(Y)andstring(X-Y)is maximum possible, wherestring(T)denotes the decimal notation of numberTwithout any leading zeroes.InputMultiple test cases. Each test case contains one line with one integerX(0 ≤X≤ 1016).OutputFor each test case output one line with one integerY.ExampleInput:1001\r\n500Output:91\r\n250",
