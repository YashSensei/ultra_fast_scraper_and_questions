  "text": "There is given a rectangular bitmap of sizen×m. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or black, but at least one is white. The pixel ini-th line andj-th column is called the pixel (i,j). The distance between two pixelsp1= (i1, j1) andp2= (i2, j2) is defined as:d(p1,p2) = |i1- i2|+|j1- j2|.TaskWrite a program which:reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input,for each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white pixel,writes the results to the standard output.InputThe number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.\r\n\r\nIn the first line of each test case there is a pair of integer numbersn, mseparated by a single space,1 ≤ n  ≤ 182,1 ≤ m ≤ 182. In each of the followingnlines of the test case exactly one zero-one word of lengthm,the description of one line of the bitmap, is written. On thej-th position in the line\r\n(i+1),1  ≤  i  ≤  n,1  ≤  j  ≤  m, is '1' if, and only if the pixel\r\n(i, j) is\r\nwhite.OutputIn thei-th line for each test case,1 ≤ i ≤ n, there\r\nshould be writtenmintegers f(i, 1) ... f(i, m) separated by single spaces, where f(i, j) is\r\nthe distance from the pixel\r\n(i, j) to the nearest white\r\npixel.ExampleSample input:1\r\n3 4\r\n0001\r\n0011\r\n0110Sample output:3 2 1 0\r\n2 1 0 0\r\n1 0 0 1",
