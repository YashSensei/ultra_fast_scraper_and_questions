  "text": "As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows many vegetables. During past months, her crop was attacked by colony of parasites. Each vegetable was attacked byAiparasites. Ada has only limited answer for this. She bought a few bottles withPrimal Fear, which is a mixture against parasites.Primal Fearworks in following way: EachPrimal Fearbottle has a power assigned to it (which is coincidentally a prime number). If it is applied to a vegetable withNparasites on it, either theNis divisible by itspower, then the size of colony is reduced toN/power, or - if the size is not divisible - then it has no effect. Also, as soon as you apply mixture against a colony, the rest of colony will become immune againstPrimal Fear.Ada didn't know what to buy so she bought one bottle of every possiblepower. Can you find out the best strategy to fight against parasites?InputThe first line of input will contain1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, the number of vegetable.The line will containNnumbers1 ≤ Ai≤     2000, the size of colony onithvegetable.OutputPrint the minimum sum of sizes of colonies which could be achieved after applyingPrimal Fearoptimally.Example Input3\r\n2 8 6Example Output8Example Input4\r\n6 6 6 6Example Output17Example Input3 \r\n7 4 22Example Output5Example Input3\r\n11 22 17Example Output13Example Input2\r\n77 11Example Output12",
