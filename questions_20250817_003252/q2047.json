  "text": "It's the spring dance and, in a rare occurrence, the N (1 ≤ N ≤\r\n5000) bulls have been invited to dance with the M (N < M ≤ 5000)\r\ncows (as long as they stay on their very best behavior).Farmer John, almost obsessive-compulsive in his organization of\r\ndances, wants the spectacle to be as visually attractive as possible.\r\nThus, he wants to pair up the N bulls with cow partners such that\r\nthe total of all the magnitudes of differences in height is minimized.\r\nBulls have heights B_i (1 ≤ B_i ≤ 1,000,000) and cows have height\r\nC_i (1 ≤ C_i ≤ 1,000,000). Of course, some cows will be unmatched\r\nsince N-M of them will have no partners; ignore their heights.InputLine 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M.Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: B_i.Lines N+2..M+N+1: Line i+N+1 contains a single integer: C_i.OutputLine 1: A single integer that is the minimum of the sum of the absolute value of the height differences that can be achieved.SampleInput:5 7\r\n10\r\n16\r\n12\r\n10\r\n13\r\n7\r\n17\r\n12\r\n10\r\n9\r\n6\r\n11Input:4ExplanationThere are five bulls + seven cows with various heights:Bulls:   10 10 12 13 16Cows:    6 7 9 10 11 12 17Here is one way to achieve a total difference of 4:Bulls:        10 10 12 13 16Cows:         9 10 11 12 17, with 6 7 unmatched.",
