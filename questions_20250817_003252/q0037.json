  "text": "You are given a sequence A ofN(N≤ 250000) integers between 1 and 50000. On this sequence you have to applyM(M≤10000) operations of the form: modify the i-th element in the sequence and then say how many inversions are there in the sequence. The number of inversions in a sequence is given by the number of pairs (i, j) with i < j and Ai > Aj.InputThe first line of input contains the numberNand the next line contains the numbers that form the sequence. After that follows the numberMand thenMlines, each containing 2 integers X and Y, meaning that new value of the X-th element of the sequence is Y and that you should count the number of inversions in the modified sequence.OutputOutput must containMlines, the i-th line of output containing the number of inversions in the sequence after the first i operations.ExampleInput:10\r\n2 6 6 4 7 6 3 5 9 1 \r\n7\r\n8 8\r\n5 1\r\n5 6\r\n10 5\r\n7 1\r\n10 10\r\n4 6Output:17\r\n18\r\n16\r\n13\r\n14\r\n8\r\n6",
