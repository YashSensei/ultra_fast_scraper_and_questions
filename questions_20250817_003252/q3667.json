  "text": "You are given a complete undirected graph withnnodes numbered from 1 ton. You are also givenkforbiddenedges in this graph.You are asked to find the number of Hamiltonian cycles in this graph that don't use any of the givenkedges. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. A cycle that contains the sameedgesis only counted once. For example, cycles 1 2 3 4 1 and 1 4 3 2 1 and 2 3 4 1 2 are all the same, but 1 3 2 4 1 is different.InputThe first line of input gives the number of cases,N(≤ 10).Ntest cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers,n(≤ 300) andk(≤ 15). The nextklines contain two integers each, representing the vertices of a  forbidden edge. There will be no self-edges and no repeated edges.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing \"Case #X:Y\", whereXis the case number (starting from 1) andYis the number of Hamiltonian cycles that do not include any of thosekedges. Print your answer modulo 9901.ExampleInput:24 11 28 41 22 34 55 6Output:Case #1: 1Case #2: 660",
