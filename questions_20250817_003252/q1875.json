  "text": "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.We define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is a prime number that consist of other prime numbers less than this number.For example: 1013 consist of 101 and 3 and both are primes.Note: 2003 is not POP because leading zero not allowed.The POP number must contain more than or equal two primes , and overlapping not allowed.InputThe first line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases. (T ≤ 104) followed by T lines, each line contains an integer m number 0 ≤ m ≤ 109.OutputFor each test case print single line contain the first integer greater than or equal to m and is POP.ExampleInput:3\r\n10\r\n100\r\n1000Output:23\r\n113\r\n1013after solving this you can tryPOP2",
