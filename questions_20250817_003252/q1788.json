  "text": "The infamous Bytelandian Bit-eating Fanatic Organisation (BBFO for short) plans to launch an \r\n\tall-out denial-of-service attack on the Bytelandian McDecimal's fast food \r\n\tnetwork by blocking the entrance to every restaurant with a camel (the \r\n\tpurpose being to rid the Organisation of unhealthy competition, \r\n\tobviously). In a sly and perfidious move, the head cryptographer \r\n\tof BBFO decided to disclose the date and time of \r\n\tthe planned attack to the management of McDecimal's, but in encrypted form \r\n\t(ha ha). He calculated the number of seconds from midnight 1970.01.01 GMT to \r\n\tthe moment of attack, squared it, divided it by 4000000007 and sent the \r\n\tremainder by e-mail to McDecimal's. This made the original date impossible to \r\n\tdecode.Or did it?*   *   *You work as the head algorithmist at McDecimal's HQ and know \r\n\tnothing of what is happening in Byteland. Things are not going well. You \r\n\tare playing a quiet game of hearts against your computer and \r\n\twondering why on earth Management are considering making you redundant. \r\n\tSuddenly, the CEO bursts into your office, saying:- Look here, young man[lady]! I have this number and those \r\n\tguys claim it is supposed to be some date. I am giving you one second to \r\n\ttell me what it all means!I am afraid you have no choice. You can't ask any further \r\n\tquestions.You just have to answer, now.InputThe encrypted timestamp.OutputThe decrypted GMT time and date of attack, somewhere \r\n\tbetween 1970 and 2030, using standard 26 character formatting.ExampleInput:1749870067Output:Sun Jun 13 16:20:39 2004",
