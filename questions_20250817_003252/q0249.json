The string distance between A and B is defined in the\r\nfollowing\r\nway (d[i,j] is the distance of substrings a1...aiand b1...bj, where 0 ≤ i ≤ k and 0 ≤ j ≤ l -- i or j being 0\r\nrepresents the empty substring). The definition for d[i, j] is d[0, 0] = 0 and for (i, j) ≠ (0, 0) d[i, j] is the minimum of all that apply:d[i, j - 1] + 1, if j > 0d[i - 1, j] + 1, if i > 0d[i - 1, j - 1], if i > 0, j > 0, and ai= bjd[i - 1, j - 1] + 1, if i > 0, j > 0, and ai≠ bjd[i - 2, j - 2] + 1, if i ≥ 2, j ≥ 2, ai= bj-1, and ai-1= bjThe distance between A and B is equal to d[k,l].For two given strings A and B, compute their distance knowing that it is not higher than 100.InputIn the first line, k and l are given, giving the lengths of the strings\r\nA and\r\nB (1 ≤ k, l ≤ 105). In the second and third lines strings A and\r\nB, respectively, are given.  A and B contain only lowercase\r\nletters of the English alphabet.OutputIn the first line, write one number, the distance between A and B,\r\nfollowed by a newline.ExampleInput:8 8\r\ncomputer\r\nkmpjutreOutput:4",
