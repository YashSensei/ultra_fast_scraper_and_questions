  "text": "You are given a board with 8×8 squares. In each square, there can be either a colored gem or no gem at all. Gems with different colors are represented by different integers.

This board is stable and you can't take away any gems in the original board. Your task is to determine whether all gems can be taken away by a single exchange or not.InputThe input consists of several test cases. Each test case will be eight lines, and each line contains eight characters. If in a square there is no gem, ‘.’ is used to identify it, otherwise an integerkis used to identify the gem's color, 1 ≤k≤ 9.There is a blank line between two consecutive test cases.End of input is indicated by a line consisting of 0.OutputFor each test case, output a single line. If all gems can be taken away by a single exchange, outputYes; otherwise outputNo.ExampleInput:........\r\n........\r\n........\r\n........\r\n........\r\n..43366.\r\n..121556\r\n44212335\r\n\r\n........\r\n........\r\n........\r\n.2......\r\n.2.22...\r\n.1.11...\r\n.2.22...\r\n.2.22...\r\n\r\n12121212\r\n21212121\r\n12121212\r\n21212121\r\n12121212\r\n21212121\r\n12121212\r\n21212121\r\n\r\n........\r\n........\r\n........\r\n........\r\n........\r\n...96...\r\n...96...\r\n.996966.\r\n\r\n0Output:Yes\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nYes",
