  "text": "A wedding is to be organized in a rectangular park of dimensionsMbyN. Some parts of the\r\npark are covered byKrectangular\r\ncarpets. These carpets, produced byItSucks Corporationare\r\nrevolutionary self cleaning carpets - they suck any liquid they come in\r\ncontact with! The organizer wants to water the park to keep the grass\r\nfresh. If there were no carpets, the organizer could have used a single\r\npipe to water the whole park but unfortunately, the water doesn't seep\r\nthrough the carpets. The organizer has at his disposalLpipes. The pipes\r\nwould be placed at fixed locations chosen by the organizer and can't be\r\nmoved. Water spreads from a pipe in all directions unless obstructed by\r\nthe park boundary or a carpet. What is the maximum area that can be\r\nwatered using theseLpipes?InputThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of\r\ntest cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 30) . Each test case starts with a\r\nsingle line containing the values M, N, K\r\nand L (1 ≤ M ≤ 10000,\r\n1 ≤ N ≤ 10000, 0 ≤ K ≤ 50,\r\n1 ≤ L ≤ 10).  It is followed by K lines, each line\r\ncontaining 4 integers separated by single spaces, x1, y1, x2, y2where (x1, y1)\r\nand (x2, y2) are the zero\r\nbased coordinates of lower left and upper right vertex of the carpet.\r\nAssume that x1< x2and y1< y2.\r\nThe carpets may cover each other. Water would not be able to\r\nseep through even if two carpets touch in a corner.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum area that can be watered on a single lineExampleInput:2\r\n10 10 0 1\r\n10 10 1 1\r\n3 3 4 4Output:100\r\n99",
