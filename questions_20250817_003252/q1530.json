  "text": "Given two arrays A and B of size n and x. Apoorv is given an empty array P. He has to fill the array according to the following conditions:for each i in range (0 to x-1) {\r\n    if b[i] is negative\r\n        (insert the subarray from A[abs(B[i]] to A[n-1] in P at the end)\r\n    else\r\n        (insert the subarray from A[0]to A[B[i]] in P at the end)\r\n}Since Apoorv loves Prime numbers He wants to know the Kth prime number in P after the above operation is completed.So given q queries Apoorv has to report the kth prime number in it. If kth prime doesn't exist print -1.Note: Both A and B are 0 indexed. abs stands for absolute value.Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 1000001 ≤ x ≤ 1000001 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10000000 ≤ abs(B[i]) ≤ n-11 ≤ q ≤ 100001 ≤ k ≤ 10000000000InputFirst line will contain n size of A.Second line will contain n space separated integers denoting A[i].Third line will contain x denoting size of B.Fourth line will contain x space separated integers denoting B[i].Fifth line will contain q denoting number of queries.Sixth line will contain q space separated integers denoting k.OutputPrint q lines denoting output for each query.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 3 4\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n1 2 3Output:2\r\n3\r\n-1ExplanationP is [2, 3, 4] so for k=1 answer is 2, for k=2 answer is 3, for k=3 answer=-1 because 3rd prime number doesn't exist.",
