Whenever she wants to harvest a single vegetable, she always replace it with another vegetable (possibly same kind).After each replacement, she wants to know the number of vegetables of the same kind (at the new vegetable) which are before it (have lower position in furrow).InputThe first line of input contains1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 2*105, the length of furrow and number of harvests.The next line containsNnumbers0 ≤ Ai≤     109the kind of vegetable which is currently onithspot in furrow (indexed from 0).The nextQlines contains two numbers0 ≤ i < N(the index of harvested plant) and0 ≤ a ≤ 109(the kind of newly planted vegetable)OutputFor each harvest, print the number of vegetables of the same kind before the newly planted vegetable.Example Input5 5\r\n1 2 1 2 1\r\n2 2\r\n4 2\r\n2 3\r\n3 3\r\n4 3Example Output1\r\n3\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2Example Input 210 10\r\n2 3 5 3 9 3 5 2 9 9\r\n7 2\r\n0 5\r\n0 2\r\n1 2\r\n9 2\r\n4 3\r\n8 2\r\n4 2\r\n2 5\r\n3 5Example Output 21\r\n0\r\n0\r\n1\r\n3\r\n1\r\n3\r\n2\r\n0\r\n1",
