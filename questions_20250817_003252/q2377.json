  "text": "The definition of a perfect number is about 2300 years old. A perfect number is defined as a positive integer which is the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of the positive divisors excluding the number itself. What can we get if,  in the sum,  we replace each divisor by its square? You can prove that there is no such number. But there are many numbers for which the sum of some divisors' squares is equal ton, so n=d12+d22+...+dk2, where d1, d2, ...,dkare distinct (positive) divisors ofn. You have to count how many times this happens. For example: the divisors ofn=120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. And there are exactly two amazing equalities:120=22+42+102120=22+42+62+82InputThe first number isT, denoting the number of test cases (T<1000).Tlines follow, each of which contains one positive integer (n<1010).OutputOutputTlines, the answer for eachn.ExampleInput:6\r\n120\r\n720\r\n1000\r\n1200\r\n92070\r\n123618780Output:2\r\n13\r\n0\r\n10\r\n6448\r\n292",
