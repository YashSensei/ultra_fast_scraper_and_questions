  "text": "Ada the Ladybug owns a circular land. She wants to enclose it with fence.\r\nAnyway since nobody sells round planks, she has decided to fence it to shape of\r\nregulark-gon. Problem is, that there is only limited number or places\r\n(on circle) where pillars can be built. Ada has asked you, to find out the\r\nnumber of different regulark-gonshaped fences which can be built on her\r\nland (twok-gon's are considered different if they share NO common pillar).InputThe first line will containT, the number of test-cases.ThenTtest-cases follow, each beginning with two integers3\r\n    ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 105,3 ≤ K ≤ 100, the number\r\nof places where pillar can be built and number of edges of regulark-gon.Afterward a line withNintegers1 ≤ Di≤ 100follow, meaning the length of arc between two consecutive points where\r\npillar can be built. The sum of all lengths will be divisible byK.Sum ofNover all test-cases won't exceed2×106.OutputFor each test-case print the number of different regulark-gonshaped fences which can be\r\nbuilt.Example Input3\r\n5 3\r\n1 2 3 2 1\r\n15 4\r\n1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 2\r\n10 5\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1Example Output1\r\n1\r\n2",
