  "text": "A number is called a mirror number if on lateral inversion, it gives the same number i.e. it looks the same in a mirror. For example 101 is a mirror number while 100 is not.Given two numbers a and b, find the number of mirror numbers in between them (inclusive of a and b).InputFirst line contains T, number of test cases ≤ 105.Each test case is described in a single line containing two numbers a and b.0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 1044OutputFor each test case print the number of mirror numbers between a and b in a single line.ExampleInput:30 1010 201 4Output:311",
