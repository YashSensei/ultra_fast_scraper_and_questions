  "text": "Numbers can be classified as IAR numbers and FA numbers.Numbers in which all digits are equal to either adjacent digit are calledIn-A-Relationshipnumbers. For example: 11, 22, 111, 9922888 and 777788822 are IAR numbers.Numbers featuring lonely digits are calledForever-Alone (FA)numbers. For example: in 22122 digit 1 is alone and in 123 all digits are alone.Given K, your task is to find the KthIn-A-Relationship (IAR)number.InputThe first line contains number of test cases T (T ≤ 50)Then T test cases follow.Each line contains one integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 5×106)OutputFor each test case, print the KthIARnumber.SampleInput:5\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n10\r\n12output:11\r\n22\r\n33\r\n111\r\n333",
