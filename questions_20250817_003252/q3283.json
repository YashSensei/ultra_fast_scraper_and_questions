  "text": "Bruce Force has had an interesting idea how to encode strings.\r\nThe following is the description of how the encoding is done:Let x1, x2... xnbe the sequence of characters of the string to be encoded.Choose an integermandnpairwise distinct numbers p1,p2... pnfrom the set {1,2...n} (a permutation of the numbers1ton).Repeat the following stepmtimes.For1≤ i ≤nset yito xpi, and then for1≤ i ≤nreplace xiby yi.For example, when we want to encode the string \"hello\", and we choose the valuem = 3and the permutation2, 3, 1, 5, 4, the data would be encoded in 3 steps:\r\n\"hello\" → \"elhol\" → \"lhelo\" → \"helol\".Bruce gives you the encoded strings, and the numbersmand p1... pnused to encode these strings.\r\nHe claims that because he used huge numbersmfor encoding, you will need a lot of time to decode the strings.\r\nCan you disprove this claim by quickly decoding the strings?InputThe input contains several test cases.\r\nEach test case starts with a line containing two numbersnandm(1 ≤ n ≤ 80,1 ≤ m ≤ 109).\r\nThe following line consists ofnpairwise different numbers p1... pn(1≤ pi≤n).\r\nThe third line of each test case consists of exactlyncharacters, and represent the encoded string.\r\nThe last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.OutputFor each test case, print one line with the decoded string.ExampleInput:5 3\r\n2 3 1 5 4\r\nhelol\r\n16 804289384\r\n13 10 2 7 8 1 16 12 15 6 5 14 3 4 11 9\r\nscssoet tcaede n\r\n8 12\r\n5 3 4 2 1 8 6 7\r\nencoded?\r\n0 0Output:hello\r\nsecond test case\r\nencoded?",
