  "text": "Today, Gerrob's RSA company has featured a New RSA cryptosystem: its public key isn, the secret keys are three distinct primesp,qandr, wheren=p*q*r. Note that the ordinary RSA uses only 2 primes! Unfortunately some hackers have stolen a DVD from the company. It does not store the secret keys, only some information about the system, namely, the values of:φ (n) - Euler's totient function andσ (n) - the sum of the divisors.Obviously you know alson, because that's public.Now, Gerrob's RSA employees are trying to determine  if hackers will be able to break the system. Could you help them to answer this question?InputThe first line contains a single integerT, the number of test cases, whereT≤ 20000. The followingTlines each contains three numbers n, φ (n) and σ (n) in this order. There are 5 input sets.OutputOutputTlines, the values ofp,qandrin increasing order. It is guaranteed thatp,q,r<106.ExampleInput:4\r\n30 8 72\r\n61321 54912 68040\r\n451464315257 451286179344 451642497600\r\n91896729624994213 91896040105364880 91897419147616160Output:2 3 5\r\n13 53 89\r\n6397 8039 8779\r\n231859 574261 690187Warning: large input/output data, be careful with certain languages.Warning: A naive algorithm will probably solve only the first input set.",
