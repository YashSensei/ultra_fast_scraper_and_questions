  "text": "The process of “breaking” an integer is defined as summing the squares of its digits. For example, the result of breaking the integer125is (12+22+52) =30. An integerNishappyif after “breaking” it repeatedly the result reaches 1. If the result never reaches 1 no matter how many times the “breaking” is repeated, then N is not a happy number.TaskWrite a program that given an integerT(number of test cases) andTintegers, determines for each number whether it is a happy number or not.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1,080,0002 ≤ N ≤ 2,147,483,647 (number for determining whether it is happy or not)InputThe first line contains an integerT.Next T lines contain an integerNfor detemining whether it is happy or not.OutputT lines containing a single integerNwhich is the number of times the process had to be done to determine that N is happy, or-1ifNis not happy.ExampleInput:219204Output:4-1ExplanationFirst test case:19  : 12+ 92= 8282  : 82 + 22= 6868  : 62+ 82= 100100 : 12+ 02+ 02= 1The solution for 19 is 4 because we discovered that the integer 19 is happy after we repeated the process 4 times.Second test case:204 →20→ 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 →20→ 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 ...204is not a happy number because after breaking it several times the results start repeating so we can deduce that if we continue breaking it, the result will never reach 1.",
