  "text": "You are given N numbers from 1 to N. Now, your task is to choose some numbers from the N numbers (including 1 and N) such that no two numbers areconsecutive. As this is easy, you are given an extra task. You have to definitely choose K numbers which are given. Find the maximum number of numbers that you can choose in such a way.InputThe first line has an integer T, the number of test cases.Then for each test case, the first line has two integers N and K.Then the next line has K numbers which you should definitely choose.OutputFor each test case, print the maximum number of numbers that you can choose.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1002 ≤ N ≤ 2 x 1061 ≤ K ≤ N / 21 ≤ X[1...K] ≤ NExampleInput:1\r\n8 2\r\n6 2Output:4",
