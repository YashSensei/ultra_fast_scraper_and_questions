  "text": "Give you N (1 <= N <= 200000) intervals, represented as [A, B], for example, interval s represented as [As, Bs].For two intervals s and t, we say S covered by T if At <= As and Bs <= Bt. Now my problem is easy, just tell me the question below: For each interval, how many intervals can cover it but not covered by it?InputThe input contains multiple test cases.For each test case, the first line is an integer N (1 <= N <= 200000), which is the number of intervals. Then come N lines, the i-th of which contains two integers: Aiand Bi(Ai, Biwill not exceed the 32-bit integer) specifying the two parameters described above.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing n space-separated integers, the i-th of which specifying the number of intervals that can cover it but not covered by it.ExampleInput:3\r\n0 1\r\n-1 2\r\n-2 3\r\n2\r\n0 1\r\n0 1Output:2 1 0\r\n0 0",
