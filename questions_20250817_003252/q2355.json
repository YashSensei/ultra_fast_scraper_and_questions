  "text": "Tim defines an integer as \"Strictly not a Prime\", if no subsequence (considering the integer as a string of digits) of the integer is a prime. He needs your help in finding how many such integers are present between two given integers A and B (including A and B).InputFirst line contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000) which denotes the total number test cases. Each test case consists of two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 100000) on a single line.OutputFor each test case, print the total count of integers which are \"strictly not a prime\" between A and B (including A and B) as per Tim.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 6\r\n7 10Output:2\r\n3",
