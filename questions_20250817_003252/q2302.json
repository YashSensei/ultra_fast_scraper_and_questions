  "text": "I really enjoy setting problemGUESSING. After three years, I decided to set another \"kind of interactive\" problem based on it.Given a link for GUESSING problem, find the server's responseSpecificationThe script runs on server works like this, the URL contains 12 digits, first 6 digits representsSEEDgenerated by random number generator, and it won't change during a guessing session. The last 6 digits representsGUESS, which is the number user just typed.The unknown part (for you, of course) is an integer functionfwhich is a bijection from [0,999999] to [0,999999].The server first generateTARGET=f(SEED), then it comparesTARGETandGUESSand give response back to user.for more details onf, it's in format (expr(x) % 1000000), and expr (x) is a expression containsonlyoperation add, subtract, multiply, division, modulo, eachexactly once, and every constants are in [0,999999], every variable is x(of course), brackets are allowed.for example, expr(x) could be \"x/12-34%(x+1)*56\", but it's invalid sincefis not a bijection.the modulo/division operations here works well if left side is a negative number, for example, -2 % 5 = 3, -2 / 5 = -1. but it's undefined if the number on the right side is not positive.Inputeach line contains a link in format\r\n\"http://www.spoj.com/problems/GUESSING/XXXXXXYYYYYY/\", whereXXXXXXYYYYYYcontains exactly 12 digit.OutputThe server's response, in format \"XAYB\".ExampleInput:http://www.spoj.com/problems/GUESSING/123456123456/http://www.spoj.com/problems/GUESSING/000000000000/Output:1A3B\r\n1A5B",
