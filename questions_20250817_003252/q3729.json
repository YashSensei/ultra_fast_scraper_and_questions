  "text": "You recently wrote a random number generator code for a web application and now you notice that some cracker has cracked it. It now gives numbers at a difference of some given value k more predominantly. You being a hacker decide to write a code that will take in n numbers as input and a value k and find the total number of pairs of numbers whose absolute difference is equal to k, in order to assist you in your random number generator testing.NOTE: All values fit in the range of a signed integer, n, k ≥ 1Input1st line contains n and k.2nd line contains n numbers of the set. All the n numbers are assured to be distinct.(Edited:n ≤ 105)OutputOne integer saying the number of pairs of numbers that have a difference of k.ExampleInput:5 21 5 3 4 2Output:3",
