  "text": "You have an unbiased coin which you want to keep tossing till you get N consecutive heads. You've already tossed the coin M times already and surprisingly, all tosses resulted in heads. What is the expected number of tosses needed till you get N consecutive heads?For example, if N = 2 and M = 0. You need to keep tossing the coin till you get 2 consecutive heads. It is not hard to show that on an average, 6 coin tosses are needed.As another example, if N = 2 and M = 1. You need 2 consecutive heads and have already got 1. In your first toss, if you get get a heads, you are done. Otherwise, you need to keep tossing the coin till you get 2 consecutive heads. The expected number of coin tosses is thus 1 + (0.5 × 0 + 0.5 × 6) = 4.0InputThe first line contains the number of cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two numbers N and M.OutputOutput T lines containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Print the answer rounded to exactly 2 decimal places.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1001 ≤ N ≤ 10000 ≤ M ≤ NSampleInput:4\r\n2 0\r\n2 1\r\n3 3\r\n3 2Output:6.00\r\n4.00\r\n0.00\r\n8.00ExplanationThe first two samples are explained above. For the third case, you already have got 3 heads, so you do not need any more tosses.",
