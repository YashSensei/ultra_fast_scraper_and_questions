  "text": "You are given the sequence of all K-digit binary numbers:\r\n0, 1 ... 2K-1.\r\nYou need to fully partition the sequence into M chunks.  Each chunk\r\nmust be a consecutive subsequence of\r\nthe original sequence.  Let Si(1 ≤ i ≤ M) be the total\r\nnumber of 1's in all\r\nnumbers in the ith chunk when written in binary, and let S be the\r\nmaximum of all Si,\r\ni.e. the maximum number of 1's in any chunk.  Your goal is to\r\nminimize S.InputIn the first line of input, two numbers, K and M (1 ≤ K ≤\r\n100, 1 ≤ M ≤ 100, M ≤ 2K), are given,\r\nseparated by a single space character.OutputIn one line of the output, write the minimum S that can be obtained\r\nby some split. Write it without leading zeros. The result is not\r\nguaranteed to fit in a 64-bit integer.ExampleInput:3 4Output:4",
