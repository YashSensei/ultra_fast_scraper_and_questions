So she decided to include a new reindeer in the original row. Taking into account that this new reindeer can be inserted in any position and he will always choose a reindeer with the best possible height.After making the task a little difficult, Noel ended up getting confused and is asking for your help to find out how many reindeer can be selected taking into account the rules imposed.InputThe first line of the entry contains an integerN(1 ≤N≤ 105) corresponding to the number of reindeer.
