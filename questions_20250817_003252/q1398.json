  "text": "EnglishVietnameseThis is a small but ancient game. You are supposed to write down the \nnumbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n − 1, 2n consecutively in clockwise order\non the ground to form a circle, and then, to draw some straight line\nsegments to connect them into number pairs. Every number must be connected\nto exactly one another.\nAnd, no two segments are allowed to intersect. It’s still a simple game, isn’t it? \nBut after you’ve written down the 2n numbers, can you tell me in how\nmany diﬀerent ways can you connect the numbers into pairs? Life is harder, right!InputEach line of the input ﬁle will be a single positive number n, except \nthe last line, which is a number −1.\nYou may assume that 1 ≤ n ≤ 150.OutputFor each n, print in a single line the number of ways to connect the 2n\nnumbers into pairs.SampleInput2\n-1Output2Note : Big num!",
