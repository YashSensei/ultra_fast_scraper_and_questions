  "text": "As you might know Ada the Ladybug is farmer. Last year, she sowedNdistinct types of grain toNdistinct places. This year she wants to seed the same types of grain again, yet there is a little problem: each type of grain needs special kind of manure, yet fertilizing soil with same kind of manure in consecutive years might destroy it.Now she is asking you to count the number of ways, to seedNtypes of grain toNplaces in such way that no type of grain will be in its original place. Since this number might be pretty big, print it modulo109+7.InputThe first line contains1 ≤ T ≤ 105, number of test-cases.Each of followingTlines contains1 ≤ N ≤     107, number of types/places.OutputFor each test case, print the number of possibilities for given number of types/places modulo 1000000007.Example Input5\r\n2\r\n3\r\n10\r\n100\r\n666Example Output1\r\n2\r\n1334961\r\n944828409\r\n769756093",
