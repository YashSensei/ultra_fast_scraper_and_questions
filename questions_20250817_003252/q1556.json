  "text": "Popatlal from Gokuldham Society is still not married. He approaches a marriage bureau and ask them to hurry the process. The bureau checks the list of eligible girls (n) and hands it over to Popatlal. Popatlal being conscious about his marriage, determined to find a girl with maximum connections so that he can gather more information about her.Accordingly, he looks to figure out the maximum number of girls (from list) who know each other to achieve above purpose. In order to finalise the girl, he needs to find the Kth prime. Where k = largest group of girls who know each other.Considering Popat's poor knowledge in Maths, he seeks for Jethalal's help for the answer. Now you, being fan of Jethalal, take this prestigious opportunity to solve Popat's marriage issue.In case number of connections are zero, print \"-1\".Note: Suppose girl \"a\" knows girl \"b\" and girl \"b\" knows girl \"c\", then girl \"a\" also knows girl \"c\" - transitivity holds.Consider 1 to be a composite number.InputFirst line of the input contains t, the number of test cases.Each line of the test case contains a number n specifying the number of girls and m specifying number of connections.Each 'm' lines contain u and v denoting that girl u and v know each other.OutputEach new line of the output contains Kth prime number, or -1 if there are no connections.Constraints1 <= t <= 1001 <= n <= 1000000 <= m <= n1 <= u, v <= nExampleInput:1\r\n10 6\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n3 4\r\n4 5\r\n6 7\r\n9 10Output:11Contributed by: Paras Jain",
