  "text": "On a rectangular mesh comprisingn*mfields,n*mcuboids were put, one cuboid on each field. A base of each cuboid\r\ncovers one field and its surface equals to one\r\nsquare inch. Cuboids on adjacent fields adhere one to another so close\r\nthat there are no gaps between them. A heavy rain pelted on a\r\nconstruction so that in some areas puddles of water appeared.TaskWrite a program which:reads from the standard input a size of the chessboard and heights of cuboids put on the fields,computes maximal water volume, which may gather in puddles after the rain,writes results in the standard output.InputThe number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.\r\nIn the first line of each test case two positive integers 1 <=n<= 100, 1 <=m<= 100 are written. They are the size of the mesh. In each of the followingnlines there aremintegers from the interval [1..10000];i-th number inj-th line denotes a height of a cuboid given in inches\r\nput on the field in thei-th column andj-th raw of the chessboard.OutputYour program should write for each tes case one integer\r\nequal to the maximal volume of water (given in cubic inches), which may gather in puddles on the construction.ExampleSample input:1\r\n3 6\r\n3 3 4 4 4 2\r\n3 1 3 2 1 4\r\n7 3 1 6 4 1Sample output:5The picture below shows the mesh after the rain (seen from above).
