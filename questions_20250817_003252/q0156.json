  "text": "Given a system of linear equations, print the solution of that system.InputInput starts with a positive integer t < 100 in a single line, then t test cases follow. Every test case represents a linear system and starts with one line containing a positive integer n < 21, the number of equations and also the number  of variables of that system. Then n equations follow, each one in a single line.An equation is written in schoolbook notation, i.e. variables noted by single small letters (English alphabet), no multiplication sign, factor 1 left out, no spaces in between.  A variable or a value may occur zero or more times in an equation. All coefficients are integers with an absolute value less than 100, a single line won't be longer than 100 characters and will always contain a valid linear equation.The following equations are considered to bevalid:a+b-c+b-2c-a=1       -x+5-9=-4x+y-8       c-c+t+1=0       y=zThe following equations are considered to beinvalid:4*a+b=6       6+-2x=99       c-c+t-t=0       4+9 = hOutputFor each test case print all variables of the linear system in alphabetical order together with the associated value  as an integer or a fraction in lowest terms respectively. Print a blank line between test cases.  For exact notation see example below. All (interim) results will fit into 64-bit,  if algorithm is implemented properly. You can assume that all linear systems have an unique solution.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\na+b=5\r\nb-a=1\r\n3\r\n5u-5z+4=0\r\n8k-3z=-2\r\n9k-u=uOutput:a=2\r\nb=3\r\n\r\nk=-4/55\r\nu=-18/55\r\nz=26/55",
