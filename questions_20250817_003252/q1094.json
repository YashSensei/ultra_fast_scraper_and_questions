You are to write a program to perform these operations, and you can see 6*7=42 or 67-25=42 or 31+11=42, maybe one of them is the problem of Life, the Universe and Everything.Please note that the solution may only be submitted in Brainf**k, Whitespace and Intercal, other languages like C/C++/Pascal/Java are not allowed!If you want to use other languages to solve this problem, you may trythisone.InputMultiple test cases, the number of them T is given in the very first line, T â‰¤ 99.Each test case contains one line which has the following form:numopernumwherenumis an integer number between 1 and 99, andoperis '+' or '-' or '*' (without quotes).There's no extra whitespace and leading zero in the input.OutputFor each test case you should output one line which contains the answer without any leading zeros. You may assume this number is always a positive one.ExampleInput:3\r\n6*7\r\n67-25\r\n31+11Output:42\r\n42\r\n42",
