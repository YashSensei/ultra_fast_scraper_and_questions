  "text": "Let f(x) be the number of 1's in the binary representation of x.We can define f^k(x) as f(x) for k = 1, and f^(k-1)(f(x)) for k > 1.Let f^*(x) be the smallest k >= 1 such that f^k(x) = 1.Given N and K, how many numbers x between 1 and N inclusive have f^*(x) = K?InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two space separated numbers N and K.Output:Output one line corresponding to each test case, containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Output all answers modulo 1000000007.SampleInput:6\r\n1 1\r\n2 1\r\n3 1\r\n3 2\r\n13 3\r\n20 2Output:1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n10Constraints1 <= T <= 10001 <= N <= 10^5001 <= K <= 10",
