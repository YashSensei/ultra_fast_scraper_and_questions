  "text": "After solving \"AP - Complete The Series (easy)\" very fast, Lucifer decided to make it little more interesting.He said he will give you the 3rd term, 4th last term and the sum of the AP series. You need print length of the series and the series.InputFirst line will contain a number indicating the number of test cases.Each of the following t lines will have 3 numbers '3term' ,'4Lastterm' and 'sum':3term - is the 3rd term in the series and4Lastterm - is the 4th last term in the series andsum - is the sum of the series.OutputFor each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.The first line should have 1 value - number of terms in the series.The second line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single space.ExampleInput:13 7 55Output:101 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10NoteIn all the test cases all the series elements are positive integers.The series will have at least 7 elements.Number of test cases ≤ 100.All the numbers will fit in 64 bits (long long in C)",
