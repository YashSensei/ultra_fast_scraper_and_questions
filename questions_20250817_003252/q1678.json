  "text": "Updating and querying 1 dimensional arrays is a popular question. How about updating and querying sub-matrices of a matrix?A sub-matrix will be depicted as (a, b), (c, d). This implies that it will include all the cells (x, y) such that a ≤ x ≤ c and b ≤ y ≤ d.The matrix is indexed from [1..N][1..N], where N is the size.You are given a matrix of size N×N, with each element initially set to 0. There are M queries and each query can be of one of the two types:1 x1 y1 x2 y2: This query asks you to return the sum of all the elements in the sub-matrix (x1, y1), (x2, y2).2 x1 y1 x2 y2 K: This query asks you to add K to each element in the sub-matrix (x1, y1), (x2, y2).InputThe first line of input contains N, M.The next M lines contain queries in the same forms as stated above.You may assume that x1 ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y2 for all queries.Also N ≤ 1000 and M ≤ 105. K ≤ 109OutputThe answer to all the queries wherein you need to return the sum of elements in the sub-matrix, i.e., all the queries of type 1.Sample Test CaseInput:5 52 2 2 4 4 41 1 1 3 32 5 5 5 5 31 1 1 1 21 2 2 5 3Output:16024Note:Please be careful with certain languages as the output may exceed the range of the data type used to store it.  Please use 64-bit integers to store the results. For example, long long in C/C++.",
