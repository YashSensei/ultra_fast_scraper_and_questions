A, B and C are all positive integers and satisfy the equation below:arctan(1/A) = arctan(1/B) + arctan(1/C)InputThe first line contains a integer number T (about 1000). T lines follow, each contains a single integer A, 1 ≤ A ≤ 60000.OutputT lines, each contains a single integer which denotes to the minimum sum B+C.ExampleSample input:1\r\n1Sample output:5Added some new test data.",
