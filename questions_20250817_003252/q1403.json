The sticks are to be processed by a woodworking machine\r\nin one by one fashion. It needs some time, called setup time, for the machine\r\nto prepare processing a stick. The setup times are associated with\r\ncleaning operations and changing tools and shapes in the machine. The setup\r\ntimes of the woodworking machine are given as follows:(a) The setup time for the first wooden stick is 1 minute.(b) Right after processing a stick of length l and weight w, the machine will\r\nneed no setup time for a stick of length l' and weight w' if l ≤ l' and w ≤ w'.\r\nOtherwise, it will need 1 minute for setup.You are to find the minimum setup time to process a given pile of n wooden sticks.For example, if you have five sticks whose pairs of length and weight are\r\n(9, 4), (2, 5), (1, 2), (5, 3), and (4, 1), then the minimum\r\nsetup time should be 2 minutes since there is a sequence of pairs (4, 1),\r\n(5, 3), (9, 4), (1, 2), (2, 5).InputThe input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T) is given\r\nin the first line of the input file. Each test case consists of two lines:\r\n The first line has an integer n, 1 <= n <= 5000, that represents the number\r\nof wooden sticks in the test case, and the second line contains 2n positive\r\nintegers l1, w1, l2, w2 ... ln, wn, each of magnitude at most 10000,\r\nwhere li and wi are the length and weight of the i th wooden stick, respectively.\r\nThe 2n integers are delimited by one or more spaces.OutputThe output should contain the minimum setup time in minutes, one per line.ExampleInput:3\r\n5\r\n4 9 5 2 2 1 3 5 1 4\r\n3\r\n2 2 1 1 2 2\r\n3\r\n1 3 2 2 3 1Output:2\r\n1\r\n3",
