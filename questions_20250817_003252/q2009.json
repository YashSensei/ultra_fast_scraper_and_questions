  "text": "Pontius: You know, I like this number 127, I don't know why.Woland: Well, that is an object so pure. You know theprime numbers.Pontius: Surely I do. Those are the objects possessed by our ancient masters hundreds of years ago. Oh, yes, why then? 127 is indeed a prime number as I was told.Woland: Not... only... that. 127 is the 31st prime number; then, 31 is itself a prime, it is the 11th; and 11 is the 5th; 5 is the 3rd; 3, you know, is the second; and finally 2 is the 1st.Pontius: Heh, that is indeed... purely prime.The game can be played on any subsetSof positive integers. A number inSis considered pure with respect toSif, starting from it, you can continue taking its rank inS, and get a number that is also inS, until in finite steps you hit the number 1, which is not inS.Whennis given, in how many ways you can pickS, a subset of {2, 3, ..., n}, so thatnis pure, with respect toS? The answer might be a big number, you need to output it modulo 100003.InputThe first line of the input gives the number of test cases,T.Tlines follow. Each contains a single integern.OutputFor each test case, output one line containing \"Case #x: y\", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is the answer as described above.LimitsT≤ 200.2 ≤n≤ 500.SampleInput:2\r\n5\r\n6Output:Case #1: 5\r\nCase #2: 8",
