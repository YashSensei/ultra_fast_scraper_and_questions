  "text": "A shop-keeper is trying to figure out how to arrange gifts in his shop for Christmas. He runs a peculiar shop such that each customer buys exactly two gifts at the shop (he could buy two of the same gifts too). He knows the probability that a customer might want gift i, is Pi.He needs to arrange the gifts across several floors. Each floor should have exactly one gift. It takes A*(|x - y|)2+ B*(|x - y|) + C seconds to go from floor x to floor y.Can you help him arrange the gifts across floors such that, the expected time spent by a shopper is minimized?For the purpose of this problem assume that the first gift choice and the second gift choice are independent of each other. i.e., Choosing a first gift as i does not change his probability of choosing the second gift as j. It still remains Pj.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. 2*T lines follow, 2 per test case. The first line contains 4 integers : N, A, B, C. The second line contains N integers in the range 1 to 100. The ith integer represents the percentage probability Pi. All Pi's will sum to 100.OutputOutput T lines one for each test case. Each line contains the minimum expected travelling time for the corresponding test case. Output the answer as a reduced fraction as below.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1001 ≤ N ≤ 200 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 10ExampleInput:4\r\n3 0 1 0\r\n60 10 30\r\n1 1 1 0\r\n100\r\n1 1 1 3\r\n100\r\n4 3 7 2\r\n25 25 25 25Output:3/5\r\n0/1\r\n3/1\r\n73/4",
