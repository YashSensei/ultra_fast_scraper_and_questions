  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is helping her friend who is biologist. He examines DNA. Actually he has a long DNA of one bug, consisting of adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine and he wants to know whether another bug might be relative to first bug. A bug is relative to another bug if his his DNA has very low Hamming Distance with some substring of the first bug.Your job is to find the lowest hamming distance between second DNA and any substring of first DNA.InputInput contains only two lines: first DNA (s) and second DNA (r).It is true that0 < |r| ≤ |s| ≤ 5*105|s|means length of strings.All strings contains onlyA, C, T, and G.OutputPrint minimalHamming     Distance(the number of mismatched nucleobases) of any substring ofsandr(the substring MUST have length|r|)Example InputsACTGACTGACTG\r\nACCGAAAAAACCA\r\nAAACAACGC\r\nGGGACTTTG\r\nTTTGAACTGACTGACTG\r\nACTGExample Output11230Inputs explanationACTGACTGACTG\r\nAAAAAACCAACGCACTTTGACTGACTGACTG",
