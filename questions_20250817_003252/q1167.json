  "text": "We define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:And we continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagon. It's called level N hexagon if it’s joined by 6 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.Task:All you have to do is to count all triangles in the “level N” hexagon.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the hexagon in that test case.OutputFor each test case, you should write a separate line: the number of triangles in the “level N” hexagon. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit positive integer)ExampleInput:1\r\n1Output:6Be careful with certain languages",
