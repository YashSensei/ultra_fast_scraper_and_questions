  "text": "A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors \r\nother than 1 and itself.we define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is \r\na prime number that consist of other prime numbers less than this number.example:1013 consist of 101 and 3 and both are primes.notes:2003 is not POP because leading zero not allowed.The POP number must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping not allowed.InputThe first line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases (T ≤ 200) followed by T lines,\r\neach line contains an integer m number 0 ≤ m ≤ 1027.OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing the first integer greater than or equal to m and is (POP).ExampleInput:3\r\n10\r\n100\r\n1000Output:23\r\n113\r\n1013time limit has been changed and all solution was rejudged.",
