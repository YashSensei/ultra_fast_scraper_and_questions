  "text": "A string is finite sequence of   characters over a non-empty finite set Σ.In this problem, Σ is the set of  lowercase letters.Substring, also called factor, is a consecutive  sequence of   characters occurrences at least once in a string.Now your task is  simple, for two given strings, find the length of the longest common substring  of them.Here common substring means a substring of two or more  strings.InputThe input contains exactly two lines, each line consists of no more than   250000 lowercase letters, representing a string.OutputThe length of the longest common substring. If such string doesn't exist,  print \"0\" instead.ExampleInput:alsdfkjfjkdsal\r\nfdjskalajfkdslaOutput:3",
