  "text": "EnglishVietnameseBy removing all digits left of the rightmost digit one in the binary representation of some integer, we get what is called the \"whirligig\" of that number. For example, the whirligig of 6 i.e. (110) 2 is 2 i.e. (10) 2, and the \nwhirligig of 40 i.e. (101000) 2 is 8 i.e. (1000) 2. \n\nWrite a program that will calculate the sum of the whirligig of all numbers between two given numbers A and B (inclusive).InputFirst and only line of input contains two integers A and B, 1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1015.OutputFirst and only line of output should contain the sum from the problem statement.Note:the result will fit into the 64-bit signed integer type.SampleInput:176 177Output:17Input:5 9Output:13Input:25 28Output:8",
