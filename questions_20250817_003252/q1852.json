  "text": "The company Chris Ltd. is preparing a new sorting hardware called Maximizer. Maximizer has n \r\ninputs numbered from 1 to n. Each input represents one integer. Maximizer has one output which \r\nrepresents the maximum value present on Maximizer's inputs.Maximizer is implemented as a pipeline of sorters Sorter(i1, j1), ... , Sorter(ik, jk). Each sorter has \r\nn inputs and n outputs. Sorter(i, j) sorts values on inputs i, i+1,... , j in non-decreasing order and \r\nlets the other inputs pass through unchanged. The n-th output of the last sorter is the output of the \r\nMaximizer.An intern (a former ACM contestant) observed that some sorters could be excluded from the pipeline \r\nand Maximizer would still produce the correct result. What is the length of the shortest subsequence of \r\nthe given sequence of sorters in the pipeline still producing correct results for all possible combinations \r\nof input values?TaskWrite a program that:reads a description of a Maximizer, i.e. the initial sequence of sorters in the pipeline,computes the length of the shortest subsequence of the initial sequence of sorters still producing \r\ncorrect results for all possible input data,writes the result.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case the first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 <= n <= 50000, 1 <= m <= 500000) separated by \r\na single space. Integer n is the number of inputs and integer m is the number of sorters in the pipeline. \r\nThe initial sequence of sorters is described in the next m lines. The k-th of these lines contains the \r\nparameters of the k-th sorter: two integers ikand jk(1 <= ik< jk<= n) separated by a single space.OutputFor each test case the output consists of only one line containing an integer equal to the length of the shortest subsequence \r\nof the initial sequence of sorters still producing correct results for all possible data.ExampleSample input:1\r\n40 6 \r\n20 30 \r\n1 10 \r\n10 20 \r\n20 30 \r\n15 25 \r\n30 40Sample output:4Warning: enormous Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
