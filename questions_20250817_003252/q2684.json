  "text": "The x% of the students in IUT(International University Of Technology) are Coders. Rest of them are non-coders. A new student got admitted into IUT who has lots of interest in programming. So, he wants to meet some senior coders of IUT. As he does not know who is coder and who is not, but he himself is a coder he has y% possibility of identifying a coder. eg. If he meets Zico_vai, He has a y% possibility that he will identify Zico_vai as coder and (100-y)% possibility that he'll make a mistake. The similar for non-coders is also true. eg. If he meets a non-coder he has y% of possibility to identify him as non-coder and (100-y)% possibility that he'll make a mistake.Now, He met a random IUTian, given x and y find the probability that he'll think the guy he met as a coder.InputFirst line of the input contains an integer 0 < t < 10000, number of test cases.Next t lines contain two integers each x, y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100) described above.OutputFor each test case in a new line, print the probability (rounded to 2 digits after decimal point) in percentage with a percentage sign.ExampleInput:2\r\n5 90\r\n12 25Output:14.00%\r\n69.00%",
