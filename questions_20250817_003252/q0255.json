  "text": "Given a string, count the number of distinct subsequences of it (including empty subsequence). For the uninformed, a subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.For example, \"AGH\" is a subsequence of \"ABCDEFGH\" while \"AHG\" is not.InputFirst line of input contains an integer T which is equal to the number of test cases. You are required to process all test cases. Each of next T lines contains a string s.OutputOutput consists of T lines. Ith line in the output corresponds to the number of distinct subsequences of ith input string. Since, this number could be very large, you need to output ans%1000000007 where ans is the number of distinct subsequences.ExampleInput:3\r\nAAA\r\nABCDEFG\r\nCODECRAFTOutput:4\r\n128\r\n496Constraints and LimitsT ≤ 100, length(S) ≤ 100000All input strings shall contain only uppercase letters.",
