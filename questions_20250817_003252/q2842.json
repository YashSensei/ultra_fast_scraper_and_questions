  "text": "Given an array of N integers A1, A2, A3…AN. If you randomly choose two indexes i, j such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N, what is the expected value of Ai| Aj?InputFirst line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. First line denotes the size of array, N and second line contains N integers forming the array.1 ≤ T ≤ 102 ≤ N ≤ 100,0000 ≤ Ai < 231OutputFor each test case, print the answer as an irreducible fraction. Follow the format of the sample output.The fraction p/q (p and q are integers, and both p ≥ 0 and q > 0 holds) is called irreducible, if there is no such integer d > 1 that divides both p and q separately.ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n0 0\r\n3\r\n1 2 3Output:0/1\r\n3/1",
