  "text": "Little boy Sai is fascinated with Natural Numbers. He especially likes Special Sets of orderk. A set of numbersS, is called Special Set of order k if, for any two numbersxandy (not necessarily distinct)belonging toS,x should not be equal to k×y.Now, Sai wants to find the size of maximum possible Special Set formed out of the numbers1, 2, 3 ... n.Hope you can help him.InputFirst line containst (1 ≤ t ≤ 105), the number of test cases. Nexttlines contain two space separated integersnandk.1 ≤ n, k ≤ 108.OutputFor each test case, output on a single line the size of maximal Special Set.ExampleInput:1\r\n6 2Output:4Explanation:For the above case, the maximal Special Set is: 1, 3, 4, 5",
