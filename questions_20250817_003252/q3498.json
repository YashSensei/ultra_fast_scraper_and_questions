  "text": "Binary Sequence of Prime Number is a binary sequence that created by converting prime number to base-2 (without leading zeros):(2)10=(10)2(3)10=(11)2(5)10=(101)2(7)10=(111)2...If all base-2 of prime number joined, then we get the binary sequence like this: 10111011111011110110...Now your task is to count how many digit '1' appear in the firstNterms of the sequence, example:If N=3, digit '1' appear 2 times:101110...If N=10, digit '1' appear 8 times:1011101111101...InputThe first line is an integerT(1 ≤T≤ 50,000), denoting the number of test cases. Then,Ttest cases follow.For each test case, there is an integerN(0 ≤N≤ 150,000,000) written in one line.OutputFor each test case, output the number of digit '1' appear in the firstNterms of the sequenceExampleInput:3\r\n3\r\n10\r\n50Output:2\r\n8\r\n36See also:Another problem added by Tjandra Satria Gunawan",
