  "text": "Just as promised, PolyProg will invite you to a bounteous pancake buffet right after this contest. Can you already feel the seductive odours dazing your senses? Well, before your mouth starts watering, you should solve this last problem.As you might know, the basic ingredients to pancakes are flour, milk and eggs. These may be completed by a passel of additional toppings such as sugar, jam, berries, cheese, ham, mushrooms etc. As the chef of the evening was yet uncertain about the recipe he’d whip up tonight, he asked his assistant simply to buy random quantities of each ingredient.With these quantities he could makeN1pancakes according to recipe 1,N2if he decides to follow recipe 2,N3for recipe 3 and so on and so forth. As the end of the competition is close, the chef will not have enough time to combine several recipes: All pancakes tonight will be of the same taste (too bad :( ). The repertoire of recipes is huge, and as we imagine you to have a ravenous appetite, you are to select the recipe that yields the largest number of pancakes.InputThe input consists of several test-cases separated by an empty line. The first line of each test-case holds the number of ingredientsN (1 ≤ N ≤ 50)the assistant bought followed by the number of recipesR (1 ≤ R ≤ 100)in the chef’s repertoire. Each of the next lines contains exactlyNnon-negative integers (no larger than 106) informing about the ingredients. The first of these lines lists the quantities the assistant bought of each ingredient. The remainingRlines list the quantities (in the same order as the previous line) necessary to make ten pancakes according to the recipe ri(from 1 toR). The input ends on a test-case having bothNandRzero, which must not be processed.OutputYour program should produce one line per test-case containing the recipe that yields the largest number of pancakes followed by the number of entire pancakes that can be made then. If there is a tie, prefer the recipe that appears first in the input.ExampleInput:3 2\r\n20 20 20\r\n5 10 1\r\n2 1 3\r\n \r\n6 3\r\n100 60 130 80 100 90\r\n10 5 10 5 10 5\r\n1 2 1 2 20 7\r\n0 0 0 10 30 1\r\n \r\n0 0Output:2 66\r\n1 100",
