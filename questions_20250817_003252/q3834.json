  "text": "Throughout history many different numbering systems have been developed. Some, like Roman numerals, have now been almost completely abandoned due to their lack of convenience. Other even more exotic numbering systems are only ever used in certain applications, such as the factoradic numbers in the context of permutation numbering. In this problem we will consider a numbering system known asbalanced base-3, which naturally appears in the analysis of diverse mathematical problems related to balance scales.The balanced base-3 system is similar to the decimal orbase-10system we are familiar with in that it ispositional. Positional numbering systems havedigitswhose relative order determines which power of thebaseaccompanies them. For example, in base-10 we have123 =1×102+2×101+3×100.In standard positional systems, the allowed digits are the numbers from0toB-1, whereBis the base of the corresponding system. Therefore, the number123in base-10 is written in standard base-3 as\"11120\"because1×34+1×33+1×32+2×31+0×30= 123.Balanced base-3 is different from standard base-3 only in the fact that the allowed digits are0,1and-1, which we will respectively denote as'0','+'and'-'. Then, the number123in base-10 is written as\"+----0\"in balanced base-3, for we have1×35+ (-1)×34+ (-1)×33+ (-1)×32+ (-1)×31+0×30= 123.Conversion from numbers in base-10 to balanced base-3 is a mechanical and somewhat tedious process, so we require a program to do it for us.

Positional numbering systems have digits whose relative order determines which power of the base accompanies them. For example, in base-10 we have123 = 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0.In standard positional systems, the allowed digits are the numbers from 0 to B-1, where B is the base of the corresponding system. Therefore, the number 123 in base-10 is written in standard base-3 as \"11120\" because1*3^4 + 1*3^3 + 1*3^2 + 2*3^1 + 0*3^0 = 123.Balanced base-3 is different from standard base-3 only in the fact that the allowed digits are 0, 1 and -1, which we will respectively denote as '0', '+' and '-'.

Can you help?InputThe first line contains an integer number T, the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 200). T test cases follow.Each test case is described by a single line containing a positive integer number N, the number in base-10 that we want to write in balanced base-3 (1 <= N <= 1000).OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing a string composed solely of the characters '0', '+' and '-', and not beginning with '0', representing the digits of the number N in balanced base-3. Note that the restriction that the string does not start with a '0' ensures this representation is unique.InputThe first line contains an integer numberT, the number of test cases (1 ≤ T ≤ 200).Ttest cases follow.Each test case is described by a single line containing a positive integer numberN, the number in base-10 that we want to write in balanced base-3 (1≤N≤1000).OutputFor each test case, print a single line containing a string composed solely of the characters'0','+'and'-'and not beginning with'0', representing the digits of the numberNin balanced base-3.
