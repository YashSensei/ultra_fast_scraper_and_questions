Informally,\r\na spanning tree of G is a selection of edges of G that form a tree spanning every vertex. That is,\r\nevery vertex lies in the tree, but no cycles (or loops) are formed. On the other hand, every\r\nbridge of G must belong to T (a bridge is an edge whose deletion increases the number of\r\nconnected components).A spanning tree of a connected graph G can also be defined as a maximal set of edges of G that\r\ncontains no cycle, or as a minimal set of edges that connect all vertices. - Wikipedia\r\nIn graph theory, a cactus (sometimes called a cactus tree) is a connected graph in which any\r\ntwo simple cycles have at most one vertex in common.

Each test case will start with a two numbers N and E where N is the number of vertices of the cactus graph, vertices are numbered from 1 to N, 3 ≤ N ≤ 81 and E is the number of edges in the graph, 2 ≤ E ≤ 120. The next E lines each one will have two numbers v and w and that means there is an edge between vertex v and w.OutputFor each test case print “Case C: X” without quotes where C is the case number starting with 1 and X is the number of ways you can convert the given cactus graph to a spanning tree.ExampleInput:2\r\n3 3\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n1 3\r\n5 5\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n2 4\r\n3 4\r\n4 5Output:Case 1: 3\r\nCase 2: 3",
