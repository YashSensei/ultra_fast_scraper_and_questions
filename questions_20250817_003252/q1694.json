  "text": "Letnum (num â‰¥ 0)is a positive integer or zero. We can represent num in the following two forms if it is possible to do so:num = n2+ 2 * n, for non-negative integer nnum = m2- 2 * m, for non-negative integer mSuppose there isnumthat can be represented in both the forms. Consider this type of number as a magic number. Consider the following 5 cases:n is the only prime.m is the only prime.n and m both are primes.n is prime.m is prime.InputFirst line of input is t, total number of test cases. For each test case the first line is q, total number of queries. Then there will be (2 * q) lines. First line contains c (referring to case mentioned in the problem description) and second line contains two integers a and b defining the range[a, b]for magic number.t < 1001q < 50010 < c < 6minimum_value_of_a = 0maximum_value_of_b = 106OutputFor every test case, that has q queries, the output has (q + 1) lines. First line will be simply printing the test case number and then q lines will be printing total number of magic numbers in the given range [a, b] under the specific case mentioned in input.ExampleInput:2315 2021 30310 18241 1051 10Output:Test Case :#1:Query :#1: 1Query :#2: 1Query :#3: 1Test Case :#2:Query :#1: 1Query :#2: 1",
