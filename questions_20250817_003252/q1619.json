  "text": "We say that two graphs are equivalent if and only if a one-to-one correspondence between their nodes can be established and under such a correspondence their edges are exactly the same. Given $A$ and $B$, two undirected simple graphs with the same number of vertexes, you are to find a series of operations with the minimum cost that will make the two graphs equivalent. An operation may be one of the following two types:Add an arbitrary edge ($x$, $y$), provided that ($x$, $y$) does not exist before such an operation. Such an operation costs $I_A$ and $I_B$ on two graphs, respectively.Delete an existing edge ($x$, $y$), which costs $D_A$ and $D_B$ on two graphs, respectively.InputThere are multiple test cases in the input file.Each test case starts with three integers, $N$, $M_A$ and $M_B$, ($1 \\le N \\le 8$, $0 \\le M_A, M_B \\le \\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$), the total number of vertexes, the number of edges in graph $A$, and the number of edges in graph $B$, respectively. Four integers $I_A$, $I_B$, $D_A$, and $D_B$ come next, ($0 \\le I_A, I_B, D_A, D_B \\le 32767$), representing the costs as stated in the problem description. The next $M_A + M_B$ lines describe the edges in graph $A$ followed by those in graph $B$. Each line consists of exactly two integers, $X$ and $Y$ ($X \\ne Y$, $0 \\le X, Y < N$).Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with $N = 0$, $M_A = 0$, and $M_B = 0$ indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.OutputPlease print the minimum cost in the format as illustrated below.ExampleSample Input1 0 0\r\n1 2 3 7\r\n\r\n4 2 3\r\n1 6 5 1\r\n0 1\r\n0 3\r\n0 2\r\n1 2\r\n1 0\r\n\r\n0 0 0Output for the Sample InputCase #1: 0\r\nCase #2: 1",
