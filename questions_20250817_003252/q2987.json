  "text": "Ada the Ladybug was on a trip with her friends. They each bought a souvenir there. As all of them are mathematicians, everybody bought a number. They want to modify the numbers to have some connection between each other. They have decided to modify the numbers so they would have theirGCDgreater than 1 (gcd(a1,a2,a3,...,aN)>1). Anyway it is not easy to change a number - the only thing they can do is to go to a professor in mathematics, which could forge a numberAinto numberA+1orA-1. As this operation is not cheap, they want to minimize number of such operations. A number might be forged any number of times.NOTE:gcd(a,0)==a(so gcd of two 0 is also 0)InputThe first line contains an integer1 ≤ N ≤ 3*105, the number of friend who were on trip (and also the number of numbers).The second line containsNintegers0 ≤ ai≤     106OutputPrint a single line with minimum number of operations to make a connection between all numbers.Example Input5\r\n3 9 7 6 31Example Output2Example Input 29\r\n3 4 5 7 8 9 11 12 13Example Output 26Example Input 35\r\n7 7 11 17 1Example Output 35",
