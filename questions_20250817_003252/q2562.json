  "text": "f(n) is defined as: f(n) = 13+23+33+...+n3, so it is the sum of the cubes of all natural numbers up to n.In this problem you are about to compute,f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ... + f(n)InputThe first line is an integerT(1 ≤T≤ 100,000), denoting the number of test cases. Then,Ttest cases follow.For each test case, there is an integern(1 ≤n≤ 1,000,000) written in one line.OutputFor each test case output the result of the summatory function described above.Since this number could be very large, output the answer modulo 1,000,000,003.ExampleInput:32103Output:10794246",
