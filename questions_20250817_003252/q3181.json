  "text": "Johnny loves to listen to music so much. Each day he decides to add, delete or listen to a music track on his laptop by doing one of the following operations:Download a new track.Delete the last downloaded track that is not deleted already.Listen to the shortest track that is already on his laptop.Each test case Johnny starts with an empty collection of tracks, at day Â Johnny decides which action to be taken depending on the value ofR[i]% 3. ifR[i]% 3 = 0 he listens to the shortest track on his laptop, ifR[i]% 3 = 1 he deletes the last downloaded track that is not deleted already, ifR[i]%3 = 2 he downloads a new track whose length isR[i]minutes. Your task is to compute the total number of minutes Johnny spends listening to music.To keep the input small, it will be codified in the following way. You will be given an arrayh. Use the following pseudo-code onhto generate an arrayR.input array:houtput array:R(of sizen)j:= 0m:= size ofhfori:= 0 ton-1R[i]:=h[j]s:= (j+1)%mh[j]:= ( (h[j]^h[s]) + 13 ) % 835454957j:=sThis code, along with the constraints, ensures that the length of each track is between 0 and 835454956, inclusive. In the above code, % is the modulus operator and ^ is the bitwise XOR binary operator. If x and y are integers, (x ^ y) represents the bitwise XOR operation on them in C/C++ and Java.InputInput will start withTnumber of test cases. Each test case will consist of 2 lines the first line starts with 0 <n<= 10,000,000 (size of arrayR), 0 <m<= 50 (size of arrayh). The second line will containMnumbers 0 <=h[i]<= 835454956 which are the elements of arrayh.OutputFor each test case, output the result using the following format:k. SWherekis the test case number (starting at 1), a single period, a single space, andSis the total time in minutes spent by Johnny listening to music.SampleInput2\r\n6 6\r\n8 5 2 4 8 9\r\n10 4\r\n9 4 3 10Output1. 5\r\n2. 52",
