  "text": "Arithmetic and geometric progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in maths.Arithmetic progression (AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 consecutive numbers is constant. For example: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9... In this series the difference between 2 numbers is 2.Geometric progression (GP) is a set in which the ratio of 2 consecutive numbers is the same. For example: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16... In this the ratio of the numbers is 2.What if there is a series in which we multiply a(n) by 'r' to get a(n+1) and then add 'd' to a(n+1) to get a(n+2)?For example: let's say d = 1 and r = 2 and a(1) = 1, the series would be 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 22, 23, 46, 47, 94, 95, 190...We add d to a(1) and then multiply a(2) with r and so on.Your task is, given 'a', 'd' and 'r' to find the a(n) term.since the numbers can be very large, you are required to print the numbers modulo 'mod' - mod will be supplied in the test case.InputFirst line of input will have number 't' indicating the number of test cases.Each of the test cases will have 2 lines. The first line will have 3 numbers 'a', 'd' and 'r'. The second line will have 2 numbers 'n' and 'mod'.a = first term of the AGS.d = the difference element.r = the ratio element.n = nthterm required to be found.mod = need to print the result modulo modOutputFor each test case print \"a(n) % mod\" in a separate line.ExampleInput:2\r\n1 1 2\r\n13 7\r\n2 2 2\r\n10 8Output:1\r\n6ExplanationFor the first test case the series is 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 22, 23, 46, 47, 94, 95, 190..., the 13thterm is 190, and 190 % 7 = 1.NotesThe value of a, d, r, n and mod will be less than 108and more than 0.For every series, the second term will be a+d and third term will be (a+d)*r, and so on.",
