  "tags": [],
  "text": "In number theory there is a very deep unsolved conjecture of the Hungarian Paul Erdős (1913-1996), that there exist infinitely many primes of the formx2+1, wherexis an integer. However, a weaker form of this conjecture has been proved: there are infinitely many primes of the formx2+y4. You don't need to prove this, it is only your task to find the number of (positive) primes not larger thannwhich are of the formx2+y4(wherexandyare integers).InputAn integerT, denoting the number of testcases (T≤500000). Each of theTfollowing lines contains a positive integern, wheren≤ 1012.OutputOutput the answer for eachn.ExampleInput:6\r\n1\r\n2\r\n10\r\n9999999\r\n500000000000\r\n1000000000000Output:0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n13175\r\n25874902\r\n42377120ps. my running time on Cube is 9.83 seconds. There is one input set.For a much easier version of this problem seeHS08PAUL.",
