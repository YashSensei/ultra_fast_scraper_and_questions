  "text": "(Maybe) someday there is a planet used to jail much prisoners from universe. One time, the prison manager collects all of prisoners, with handcuff in their hand locked. He orders to officers to unlock all handcuffs. Then, he orders to officers to look at prisoners whose number can divided by two. If his/her handcuff is locked, the open it, otherwise, lock it. Then, he orders again to all officers to look at prisoners whose number can divided by three, and so on.You, the universe criminal researcher, is requested to calculate the environmental criminal impact by calculating ratio of freed prisoners about all prisoners to the number of prisoners are known.InputLine 1 contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) number of test cases. Then T next lines contains one number K (1 ≤ K ≤ 101000), the number of prisoners.OutputOutput contains K lines, contains the probability of freed prisoners about all prisoners. The probability precision is 10-500with bankers' rounding method.ExampleInput:25100Output (split for readability) :0.400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Whitespace Explanation:If there no input in any line, then do not print any line :)) Sorry for inconvenience. >:)",
