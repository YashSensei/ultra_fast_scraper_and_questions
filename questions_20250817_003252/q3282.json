  "text": "Bruce Force's keyboard is broken, only a few keys are still working. Bruce has\r\nfigured out he can still type texts by switching the keyboard layout whenever\r\nhe needs to type a letter which is currently not mapped to any of themworking keys of the keyboard.You are given a text that Bruce wishes to type, and he asks you if you can tell him\r\nthe maximum number of consecutive characters in the text which can be typed without\r\nhaving to switch the keyboard layout.\r\nFor simplicity, we assume that each key of the keyboard will be mapped to exactly one character, and it is not possible to type other characters by combination of different keys.\r\nThis means that Bruce wants to know the length of the largest substring of the text\r\nwhich consists of at mostmdifferent characters.InputThe input contains several test cases, each test case consisting of two lines.\r\nThe first line of each test case contains the numberm(1 ≤ m ≤ 128),\r\nwhich specifies how many keys on the keyboard are still working.\r\nThe second line of each test case contains the text which Bruce wants to type.\r\nYou may assume that the length of this text does not exceed 1 million characters.\r\nNote that the input may contain space characters, which should be handled like any other character.The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.OutputFor each test case, print one line with the length of the largest substring\r\nof the text which consists of at mostmdifferent characters.ExampleInput:5\r\nThis can't be solved by brute force.\r\n1\r\nMississippi\r\n0Output:7\r\n2",
