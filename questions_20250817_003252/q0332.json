  "text": "We say that a sequence of integers is a one-sequence if the difference between any two consecutive numbers in this sequence is 1 or -1 and its first element is 0. More precisely: [a1,a2, ...,an] is a one-sequence iffor anyk, such that 1 <=k<n: |ak-ak+1| = 1 anda1= 0TaskWrite a program that for each test case:reads two integers describing the length of the sequence and the sum of its elements;finds a one-sequence of the given length whose elements sum up to the given value or states that such a sequence does not exist;writes the result to the standard output.InputThe number of test casestis in the first line of input, thenttest cases follow separated by an empty line.In the first line of a test case there is a numbern, such that 1 <=n<= 10 000, which is the number of elements in the sequence. In the second line there is a numberS, which is the sum of the elements of the sequence, such that |S| <= 50 000 000.OutputFor each test case there should be writtennintegers (each integer in a separate line) that are the elements of the sequence (k-th element in thek-th line) whose sum isSor the word \"No\" if such a sequence does not exist. If there is more than one solution your program should output any one.Consequent test cases should by separated by an empty line.ExampleInput:1\r\n8\r\n4Output:0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n1\r\n0\r\n-1\r\n0\r\n1",
