  "text": "Given a sequence of consecutive integers n, n+1, n+2 ... m, an anti-prime sequence is a rearrangement\r\nof these integers so that each adjacent pair of integers sums to a composite (non-prime) number. For\r\nexample, if n = 1 and m = 10, one such anti-prime sequence is 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 10. This is also the\r\nlexicographically first such sequence.We can extend the definition by defining a degree d anti-prime sequence as one where all consecutive\r\nsubsequences of length 2, 3 ... d sum to a composite number. The sequence above is a degree 2 anti-prime\r\nsequence, but not a degree 3, since the subsequence 5, 4, 2 sums to 11. The lexicographically\r\nfirst degree 3 anti-prime sequence for these numbers is 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 10, 8, 7, 9.InputInput will consist of multiple input sets. Each set will consist of three integers, n, m, and d on a single\r\nline. The values of n, m and d will satisfy 1 ≤ n < m ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ d ≤ 10. The line 0 0 0 will\r\nindicate end of input and should not be processed.OutputFor each input set, output a single line consisting of a comma-separated list of integers forming a degree\r\nd anti-prime sequence (do not insert any spaces and do not split the output over multiple lines). In the\r\ncase where more than one anti-prime sequence exists, print the lexicographically first one (i.e., output\r\nthe one with the lowest first value; in case of a tie, the lowest second value, etc.). In the case where no\r\nanti-prime sequence exists, output:No anti-prime sequence exists.ExampleInput:1 10 2\r\n1 10 3\r\n1 10 5\r\n40 60 7\r\n0 0 0Output:1,3,5,4,2,6,9,7,8,10\r\n1,3,5,4,6,2,10,8,7,9\r\nNo anti-prime sequence exists.\r\n40,41,43,42,44,46,45,47,48,50,55,53,52,60,56,49,51,59,58,57,54",
