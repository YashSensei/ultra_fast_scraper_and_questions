  "text": "Multiplication of natural numbers in general is a cumbersome operation. In some cases however the product can be obtained by moving the last digit to the front.Example: 179487 × 4 = 717948Of course this property depends on the number system you use, in the above example we used the decimal representation. In base 9 we have a shorter example:17 × 4 = 71 (base 9)as (9 × 1 + 7) × 4 = 7 × 9 + 1InputEach line consists of three numbers separated by a space: the base (≤ 36) of the number system, the least significant digit of the first factor, and the second factor. This second factor is one digit only hence less than the base. The input file ends with the standard end-of-file marker.All Numbers in input are greater than 1 and will fit in the standard \"int\" data type. For base > 10 you can assume the digits to be 'A' ... 'Z'.Note: Numbers in input may or may not be expressed using the above digits (refer example)OutputYour program determines for each input line the number of digits of the smallest first factor with the rotamult property. Each line contains the answer for the corresponding input line.ExampleInput:10 7 4\r\n9 7 4\r\n17 14 12\r\n17 E COutput:6\r\n2\r\n4\r\n4The last two inputs are actually the same.",
