  "text": "LoadingTime got a RNG (Random Number Generator) from his classmate several weeks ago. And he spent a lot of time study it. He found that RNG can generate a real number in range [-S,S] by executing following steps. First RNG generates n integerX1...Xn, the sum of which is equal toS. Then for eachXi, it generates a real number in range [-Xi,Xi] randomly. The output (a real number) of RNG will be the sum of theNgenerated real numbers. LoadingTime noticed that the distribution of the output was very interesting, and he wanted to know: for givenNandX, what's the probability that the generated number is in range [A,B]. Could you help him?InputThe first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases.For each test case, the first line contains three integersN,A,B(1 ≤N≤ 10, -100 ≤A≤B≤ 100) In the second line of the test case, you are givenX1...Xn(1 ≤Xi≤ 10).OutputFor each test case, print a line contains a real number representing the probability as the problem required. It must be printed with exactly nine decimal places.ExampleInput:5\r\n1 -100 100\r\n10\r\n1 10 90\r\n10\r\n1 -20 5\r\n10\r\n2 -20 5\r\n5 5\r\n5 -5 10\r\n1 2 3 4 5Output:1.000000000\r\n0.000000000\r\n0.750000000\r\n0.875000000\r\n0.864720052",
