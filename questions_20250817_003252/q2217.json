  "text": "Alice has a problem. She loves Bob but is unable to face up to him. So she decides to send a letter to Bob expressing her feelings. She wants to send it from her computer to Bob's computer through the internet.The internet consists of $N$ computers, numbered from $1$ to $N$. Alice's computer has the number $1$ and Bob's computer has the number $N$.Due to some faulty coding, the computers start behaving in unexpected ways. On recieving the file, computer $i$ will forward it to computer $j$ with probability $P_{ij}$. The time taken to transfer the file from computer $i$ to computer $j$ is $T_{ij}$.Find the expected time before Bob finds out about Alice's undying love for him.Note:Once the letter is recieved by Bob's computer, his computer will just deliver it to Bob and stop forwarding it.InputFirst line contains $T$, the total test cases.Each test case looks as follows:First line contains $N$, the total number of computers in the network.The next $N$ lines contain $N$ numbers each. The $j$'th number on the $i$'th line is the value $P_{ij}$ in percents.The next $N$ lines contain $N$ numbers each. The $j$'th number on the $i$'th line is the value $T_{ij}$.OutputOutput a single line with a real number - The expected time of the transfer.Your output will be considered correct if each number has an absolute or relative error less than $10^{-6}$.Constraints$N \\le 100$$T \\le 5$For all $i$, $P_{i1} + P_{i2} + \\ldots + P_{iN} = 100$$P_{NN} = 100$For all $i$, $j$, $0 \\le T_{ij} \\le 10000$You can safely assume that from every computer, the probability of eventually reaching Bob's computer is greater than $0$.ExampleSample Input:2\r\n4\r\n0 50 50 0\r\n0 0 0 100\r\n0 0 0 100\r\n0 0 0 100\r\n0 2 10 0\r\n0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0\r\n2\r\n99 1\r\n0 100\r\n10 2\r\n0 0Sample Output:6.000000\r\n992.000000",
