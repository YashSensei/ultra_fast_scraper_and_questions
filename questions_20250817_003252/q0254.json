Each of the next M lines consists of three integers Ai, Biand Ri— description of a resistor that has resistance Riconnecting the nodes Aiand Bi(1 ≤ Ai, Bi≤ N; 1 ≤ Ri≤ 100).There's a blank line between consecutive test cases in the input file. No other extra whitespace will/should be appear in the input/output.Input terminates by EOF.OutputFor each test case, output the total resistance between the nodes 1 and N rounded within two digits after the decimal point. There won't be any test case the output for which is +INF.ExampleInput:4 5\r\n1 2 15\r\n2 4 5\r\n1 3 10\r\n3 4 10\r\n2 3 1Output:9.40",
