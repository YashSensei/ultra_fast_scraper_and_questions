  "text": "An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers a1, a2... ansuch that ai+1-aiis equal for all 0 ≤ i < n. This difference is called the common difference of the arithmetic progression.Now consider a sequence of arithmetic progressions A1= (a1,1, a1,2... a1,n1), A2= (a2,1, a2,2... a2,n2) ... Ak= (ak,1, ak,2... ak,nk)A progressive progression is such a sequence with the additional properties that:ai,ni= ai+1,1for 1 ≤ i < kci, the common difference of Ai, is a positive factor of ai,1for 1 ≤ i ≤ kcii+1 for 1 ≤ i < kni> 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ kk ≥ 1Find the number of progressive progressions such that a1,1=1 and ak,nk= N. As this number can be quite large, output it modulo 100000007.InputThe first line of input contains T (≤ 100), the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases. The description of each test case consists of a single integer N (1 < N ≤ 1000000).OutputFor each test case, output modulo 100000007 the number of progressive progressions such that a1,1=1 and ak,nk= NExampleInput:2\r\n5\r\n10Output:1\r\n6",
