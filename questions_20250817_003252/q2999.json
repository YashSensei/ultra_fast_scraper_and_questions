  "text": "You are given an array of integer. You have to find the sum of all possible subsequences sum of the array. For example: The given array of length n = 3 is {1, 2, 3}. All the subsequences of this array with the corresponding array summations are:SubsequenceSummation{}0{1}1{2}2{3}3{1,2}3{1,3}4{2,3}5{1,2,3}6Total24The answer is 24.InputThe first line of input will contain the test caseT (1 ≤ T  ≤ 10). There will be two lines for each test case. First line will contain the value ofn (1  ≤ n  ≤ 1000)and the next line will contain the array elements space-separated integers. Each integer will be between 1 and 1000000000.OutputFor each case of input, output the answer of the problem in the format \"Case X: Y\" whereXdenotes the number of the test case andYdenotes the answer. Answer could be very large so output the answer modulo100000007.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n1 2 3\r\n3\r\n4 1 2Output:Case 1: 24\r\nCase 2: 28",
