  "text": "Sacchi and Maurya are string lovers. They love to solve problems on strings. So our born-talented Priyun decided to ask them a problem on strings. He gave them a string of size S which consists of only lowercase English letters. According to Priyun some of the alphabets are “Nice” and rest all are “Eww”. Now Priyun has a tolerance level of X “Eww”.Priyun wants to know the distinct substrings of the given string which he can tolerate.Even Sacchi and Maurya are finding it difficult to solve. So help them.InputThe input file consists of several cases T [1 ≤ T ≤ 10].The first line of each test case consists of a string S, [Size of S is ≤ 2000, S consists of only lowercase English Letters.]Next line contains the number P [0 ≤ P ≤ 26], the number of “Nice” alphabets.Next P lines contains an alphabet that is Nice. All the P characters are distinct and between [a, z].Next line contains an integer X i.e. the tolerance level of Priyun.OutputPrint a single integer for each test case i.e  the number of distinct substrings that Priyun can tolerate.ExampleInput:1bbbbbbbbba1b0Output:9",
