  "text": "Pascal’s triangle is a common figure in combinatorics. It is a triangle formed by rows of integers. The top row contains a single 1. Each new row has one element more than the previous one and is formed as follows: the leftmost and rightmost values are 1, while each of the other values is the sum of the two values above it. Here we depict the first 7 rows of the triangle.1\r\n                    1   1\r\n                  1   2   1\r\n                1   3   3   1\r\n              1   4   6   4   1\r\n            1   5  10  10   5   1\r\n          1   6  15  20  15   6   1Pascal’s triangle is infinite, of course, and contains the value 1 an unbounded number of times. However, any other value appears a finite number of times in the triangle. In this problem you are given an integer K ≥ 2. Your task is to calculate the number of values in the triangle that are different from 1 and less than or equal to K.InputThe input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains an integer K (2 ≤ K ≤ 109). The last line of the input contains a single −1 and should not be processed as a test case.OutputFor each test case output a single line with an integer indicating the number of values in Pascal’s triangle that are different from 1 and less than or equal to K.ExampleInput:2\r\n6\r\n-1Output:1\r\n10",
