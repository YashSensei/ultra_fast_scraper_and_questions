Sequentially adding M undirected edges (u, v) to the graph (0 <= u, v <= N - 1). After adding an edge, you must print out the current number of bridges in the graph. The data guarantees that there is no request to add an existed edge, or an edge from a vertex to itself.InputThe first line contains an integer T (T <= 10) denotes the number of test cases. Each test case begins with 2 integers N (1 <= N <= 50000) and M (1 <= M <= 100000), followed by M lines, each line contains a pair of integers (u, v) represents a request to add an edge (u, v) to the graph.OutputAfter each request, print out the current number of bridges in the graph on a separate line.ExampleFor the input data:1\n5 10\n3 0\n0 2\n1 0\n1 3\n1 4\n2 4\n4 0\n2 1\n2 3\n3 4the correct result is:1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0",
