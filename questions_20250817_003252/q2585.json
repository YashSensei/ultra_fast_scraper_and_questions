  "text": "A 123 sequence is defined as a non-decreasing sequence of length ≥ 2, where each number is 1 or 2 or 3. The difference between all unique pairs of numbers is given i.e. for a 123 sequence a1, a2, a3... and the differences are aj-aifor 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.Since the 123 sequence contains only 1, 2, 3 the difference between any pair can be 0, 1, 2. Given the number of 0s, 1s, 2s in the difference sequence X, Y, Z respectively, your task is to find the number of distinct 123 sequences that could result in X, Y, Z.Two 123 sequences A and B are considered different if there exists at least one i such that Aiis not equal to Bi.InputFirst line of the input contains the number of test cases T. (T ≤ 10000). Then follow T lines each containing 3 space separated integer X, Y, Z. (0 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 108, X + Y + Z > 0).OutputFor each test case output the number of distinct 123 sequences in a separate line.ExampleInput:30 2 11 2 31 3 2Output:102ExplanationFor the third test case the 123 sequences are 1, 2, 3, 3 and 1, 1, 2, 3.",
