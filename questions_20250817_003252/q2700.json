  "text": "Given a large polygon dining table (not always a simple polygon) with the following properties :- there is no intersecting area (ex : area A)- there is no space inside the polygon (ex : area B)- there is no 3 edges that are concurrent (ex : point C)- every nodes are not lying on any edge except 2 edges that connect that node with 2 other nodes (ex : point D)- every nodes forming a convex corner because a table with concave corner is an uncomfortable table (ex : point E)Example of invalid table :Given also M dishes with the following rules :- placed on the table- not on the edge of the table- there is no pair of different food that have the same placeYou have to answer Q queries :- each query identified by L and R- the query is \"what is the minimum moves in order to make some dishes (from L-th dish to R-th dish inclusive) placed in same region ?\"- queries are independentNotes :- two dishes are considered in same region if and only if from one dish can be slid to another one without crossing any edge- one move is to slide a dish to another region through an edge- every dishes should be still on the table, but they may lie on the edgeExplanation :- dish A is valid because it placed on the table- dish C is invalid because it placed on the edge- dish E is invalid because it placed outside the table- sliding from dish A to dish B is considered as one move- dish B and dish D is considered as one region- dish F is invalid because it placed exactly on dish DInput and output format :- An integer T represent the number of test case, each test case :- First line contains 3 separated integer N, M, and Q- Next N lines contain Xi and Yi represent the coordinate of i-th node- Next M lines contain Pi and Qi represent the coordinate of i-th dish- Next Q lines contain Li and Ri represent the parameter of i-th query- You should output Q lines contain the answers of those queriesConstraints :- 1 <= T <= 10- 3 <= N <= 1000- 2 <= M <= 1000- 1 <= Q <= 1000- 0 <= Xi, Yi <= 10^9- 0 < Pi, Qi < 10^9- 1 <= Li < Ri <= MSample input :17 5 31 11 55 17 27 89 55 56 22 35 48 65 31 52 43 5Sample output :221Explanation of sample :- query 1 : we can slide 2-nd dish and 4-th dish to the middle region- query 2 : using the same way as query 1- query 3 : prefer sliding 4-th dish (1 move) rather than sliding 3-rd and 5-th dishes (2 moves)",
