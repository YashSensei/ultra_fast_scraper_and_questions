  "text": "Manku loves Codechef's Lucky Number and now he decided to start Manku words :)Manku words are those words which have only letters 'm', 'a', 'n', 'k', 'u'.Generally in english, 'a' comes before 'k', 'k' comes before 'm' and so on. But in Manku's dictionary, 'm' comes before 'a', 'a' comes before 'n', 'n' comes before 'k', 'k' comes before 'u'.Thus according to manku1st manku word is m2nd manku word is a3rd manku word is n4th manku word is k5th manku word is u6th manku word is mm7th manku word is maand so on ...Your task is very simple. For given value of n, write the n-th manku word.InputFirst line of input contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100).Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^18).OutputFor every test case print the n-th manku word on separate line.ExampleInput:5\r\n10\r\n4\r\n16\r\n17\r\n31Output:mu\r\nk\r\nnm\r\nna\r\nmmm",
