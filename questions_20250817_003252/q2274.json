  "text": "We have an infinite non-decreasing sequence A which is created as follows:A[1] = 1 and A[2] = 2.A number i occurs A[i] times in the sequence.First few terms in the sequence are: { 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7... }. Note that 3 occurs 2 times in the sequence, (because A[3] = 2).Your task is to find the term A[n] for any given n, where 0 < n <= 1e13.InputFirst line contains t, the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains a number n.OutputFor every case, print the nth term of the sequence.ExampleInput:2\r\n5\r\n12Output:3\r\n6",
