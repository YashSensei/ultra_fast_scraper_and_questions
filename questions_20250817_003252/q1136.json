  "text": "A cashier in a grocery store seems to have difficulty in\r\ndistinguishing the multiplication symbol and the addition symbol. \r\nTo make things easier for him, you want to buy goods in such a\r\nway that the product of their prices is the same as the sum of\r\ntheir prices.Of course, if you buy only one item, this is always true. With two\r\nitems and three items, it still seems quite a boring task to you,\r\nso now you are interested in finding possible prices of four items\r\nsuch that the sum of the four prices is equal to the product of the\r\nfour prices. You should consider the prices are in € with two\r\ndigits after the decimal point. Obviously, each product costs at\r\nleast one cent.InputThis problem has no input.OutputPrint all solutions which have a sum of the four items of at most€20.00. For each solution, print one line with\r\nthe prices of the four items in non-decreasing order, with one space\r\ncharacter between them. You may print the solutions in any order,\r\nbut make sure to print each solution only once.Sample Output0.50 1.00 2.50 16.00\r\n1.25 1.60 1.75 1.84\r\n1.25 1.40 1.86 2.00\r\n...",
