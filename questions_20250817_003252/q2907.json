  "text": "Captain Claw is at the bank of a river of acid and he needs to cross it. The river is x metres wide but Captain Claw can jump at most d metres.However, the Captain can jump on stones which keep appearing in the stream.InputThere are multiple test cases. For each test case.The first line contains n, x and d.The next n lines denotes subsequent seconds.For each line, the first integer, c, denotes the number of number of stones appearing in this second.Then c integers follow.The ith integer means that a stone would appears at the position of that integer.Find the minimum time needed by the Captain to cross the river.1 ≤ t ≤ 301 ≤ x ≤ 1051 ≤ d ≤ x1 ≤ n ≤ 1031 ≤ sum(c) ≤ 105AssumptionCaptain Claw is super fast. The time taken by jumps is negligible to a second.OutputPrint a single integer in each line - the time taken to cross the river.Output -1 if its not possible to cross the river in n seconds.ExampleInput:14 6 21 51 31 11 2Output:3Explanation:Sec 1: Captain WaitsSec 2: Captain WaitsSec 3: Captain Jumps from bank(0) → 1 → 3 → 5 → bank(6)",
