  "text": "Integer X is Square-Free if and only if p2(p is prime) does not divide it. For example, 15 is a square-free number but 12 isn't, because 22= 4 is one of its divisors.Write a program that outputs whether the product of two numbers is a square-free number.InputThe first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), the number of test cases. T lines follow, one per test case. Each of these lines contain two integersaandb(1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1018).a and b are NOT necessarily square-free.OutputPer test case:Output a single line containing \"YES\" if the product ofaandbis square-free, or \"NO\" otherwise. In any case, do not include quotes in your output.SampleInput4\r\n1 1\r\n6 13\r\n10 2\r\n12 1OutputYES\r\nYES\r\nNO\r\nNO",
