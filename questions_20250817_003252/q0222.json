  "text": "Martin and Isa are very competitive. The newest competition they have created is about looking\r\nat the plates of the cars. Each time one of them sees a car plate in the streets, he or she sends\r\nto the other an SMS message with the content of that plate; the one who has seen the newest\r\nplate is in the lead of the game. As the Automobile Car Management (ACM) office assigns the\r\nplates sequentially in increasing order, they can compare them and find out who is the winner.Martin has a very smart eye and he has stayed on the lead for several weeks. Maybe he keeps\r\nlooking at the streets instead of working, or maybe he stays all day in front of car selling\r\ncompanies waiting for new cars to go out with new plates. Isa, tired of being always behind,\r\nhas written a program that generates a random plate, so the next time Martin sends a message\r\nto her, she will respond with this generated plate. In this way, she hopes to give Martin a hard\r\ntime trying to beat her.However, Martin has grown suspicious, and he wants to determine if Isa actually saw a car with\r\nthe plate she sent or not. This way, he will know if Isa is in the lead of the game.He knows some facts about the plates assigned by the ACM:Each plate is a combination of 7 characters, which may be uppercase letters (A-Z), or\r\ndigits (0-9).There exists two kinds of plate schemes: the old one, used for several years, and the new\r\none which has been in use for some months, when the combinations of the old one were\r\nexhausted.In the old scheme, the first three characters were letters, and the last four were digits, so\r\nthe plates run from AAA0000 to ZZZ9999.In the new scheme, the first five characters are letters, and the last two are digits. Unfortunately\r\nthe chief of ACM messed up with the printing system while he was trying\r\nto create a poster for his next campaign for mayor, and the printer is not able to write\r\nthe letters A, C, M, I, and P. Therefore, in this new scheme, the first plate is BBBBB00,\r\ninstead of AAAAA00.The plates are assigned following a sequential order. As a particular case, the last plate\r\nfrom the old scheme is followed by the first plate from the new scheme.As Isa is not aware of all of this, she has just made sure that her random generator creates a\r\ncombination consisting of seven characters, where the first three characters are always uppercase\r\nletters, the last two characters are always digits, and each one of the fourth and fifth characters\r\nmay be an uppercase letter or a digit (possibly generating an illegal combination, but she has\r\nnot much time to worry about that).Of course, Martin will not consider Isa the winner if he receives an illegal combination, or if he\r\nreceives a legal plate, but equal to or older than his. But that’s not all of it. Since Martin knows\r\nthat new plates are not generated too fast, he will not believe that Isa saw a car with a plate\r\nnewer than the one he sent, but sequentially too far. For example, if Martin sends DDDDD45,\r\nand receives ZZZZZ45, he will not believe that Isa saw a car with that plate, because he knows\r\nthat the ACM couldn’t have printed enough plates to get to ZZZZZ45 in the time he received\r\nthat answer.So, Martin has decided to consider Isa the winner only if he receives a legal plate, newer than\r\nhis, and older than or equal to the C-th consecutive plate after the one he sent. He calls C his\r\nconfidence number. For example, if Martin sends ABC1234, and his confidence number is 6, he\r\nwill think that Isa is the winner only if he receives any plate newer than ABC1234, but older\r\nthan or equal to ABC1240.InputThe input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains\r\ntwo strings SMand SI, and an integer C, separated by single spaces. SMis the 7-character\r\nstring sent by Martin, which is always a legal plate. SIis the 7-character string answered\r\nby Isa, which was generated using her random generator. C is Martin’sconfidence number(1 <= C <= 109).\r\nThe end of input is indicated by SM= SI=“*” and C = 0.OutputFor each test case, output a single line with the uppercase character “Y” if, according to Martin,\r\nIsa is the winner, and with the uppercase character “N” otherwise.ExampleInput:ABC1234 ABC1240 6\r\nABC1234 ABC1234 6\r\nACM5932 ADM5933 260000\r\nBBBBB23 BBBBC23 100\r\nBBBBB23 BBBBD00 77\r\nZZZ9997 ZZZ9999 1\r\nZZZ9998 BBBBB01 3\r\nZZZZZ95 ZZZZZ99 10\r\nBBBBB23 BBBBB22 5\r\n* * 0Output:Y\r\nN\r\nN\r\nN\r\nY\r\nN\r\nY\r\nY\r\nN",
