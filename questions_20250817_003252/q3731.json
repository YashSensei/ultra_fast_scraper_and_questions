  "text": "Given a string, you keep swapping any two characters in the string randomly until the string becomes a palindrome. What is the expected number of swaps you will make?InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains a string each.OutputOutput T lines containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Print the answer rounded to exactly 4 decimal places.Constraints:T â‰¤ 10000The length of the string will be at most 8 characters.The string will consist of only lower-case letters 'a'-'z'.There will always be at least one palindrome which can be formed with the letters of the given string.SampleInput:4\r\nb\r\nbb\r\nabb\r\ncbaabbbOutput:0.0000\r\n0.0000\r\n3.0000\r\n59.3380ExplanationFor the first two cases, the string is already a palindrome so no swaps are needed.For the third case, there are 3 possible swaps. The string will become \"bab\",\"bba\" or remain \"abb\" with 1/3rd probability each. It's easy to see that the expected number of swaps needed is 3.0000For the last case, the answer is 59.337962..., which should be printed as 59.3380",
