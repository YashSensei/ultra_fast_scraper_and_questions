  "text": "You are given N tuples with M dimensions. You need to choose some tuples and divide them into M groups. Each tuple can be used for only once and the size of the ithgroup is Ci. We define the score of the ithgroup is the sum of value in the ithdimension of the tuples in the ithgroup. Your target is to firstly maximize the score of 1stgroup, then maximize the score 2ndgroup and so on.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T (T ≤ 50), indicating the number of cases. Each case begins with two integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000) and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 10), the number of tuples and the number of groups. Then there is one line contain M integers. The ithinteger Ci(Ci≥ 0, sigma Ci≤ N) represents the size of the ithgroup. Then N lines with M integers follow. Each of them describes a tuple. The jthinteger on the ithline Tij(0 ≤ Tij≤ 10000) denotes the value of the jthdimension of the ithtuple.OutputFor each test case, print one line with M score of some optimal division.ExampleInput:2\r\n4 2\r\n2 1\r\n3 2\r\n2 1\r\n2 2\r\n1 1\r\n4 3\r\n1 1 2\r\n8 7 1\r\n8 7 2\r\n8 7 4\r\n8 2 3Output:5 2\r\n8 7 7HintIn case 2, we can divide the group like:Group 1: (8, 7, 2)  score = 8Group 2: (8, 7, 1)  score = 7Group 3: (8, 7, 4), (8, 2, 3) score = 4 + 3 = 7",
