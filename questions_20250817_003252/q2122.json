  "text": "A regular convex polygon is a polygon where each side has the same length, and all interior angles are equal and less than 180 degrees. A square, for example, is a regular convex polygon. You are given three points which are vertices of a regular convex polygonR; can you determine the minimum number of vertices thatRmust have?InputEach test case consists of three lines. Lineiconsists of two floating point valuesxiandyi(−104≤x1,y1≤ 104) where (xi,yi) are the coordinates of a vertex ofR. The coordinates are given with a precision of 10−6, i.e., they differ from the exact coordinates by at most 10−6. You may assume that for each test case the Euclidean distance between any two given points is at least 1, andRhas at most 1000 vertices. The input will finish with a line containing the wordEND.OutputFor each test case, print one line with the minimum number of vertices thatRmust have.Sample Input-1385.736326 -146.954822\r\n430.000292 -2041.361203\r\n1162.736034 478.316025\r\n0.000000 4147.000000\r\n-4147.000000 0.000000\r\n0.000000 -4147.000000\r\nENDSample Output3\r\n4Problem setter: Adrian Kuegel",
