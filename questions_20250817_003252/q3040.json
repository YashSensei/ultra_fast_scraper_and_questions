  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has a long furrow in which she grows trees. Each tree has some weight. The task is simple, she wants to know the biggest tree on some part of the furrow which is not greater than some heightH. As Ada asks for this very often, she asked you to write a program for this.InputThe first line will contain two integer1 ≤ N, Q ≤     3×105, the number trees and the number of questions.The next line will containNintegers0 ≤ Ai≤     106, the heights of trees.The sum nextQwill contain three integers:0 ≤ l ≤ r <     N, the segment of furrow she is interested in and0 ≤ H ≤ 106OutputFor each query output either the size of highest tree lesser/equal toHor output0if such tree doesn't grow on given segment.Example Input9 8\r\n1 5 9 11 9 7 6 2 1\r\n1 6 4\r\n1 6 10\r\n0 8 97\r\n0 8 4\r\n1 4 5\r\n2 6 8\r\n2 8 5\r\n3 3 12Example Output0\r\n9\r\n11\r\n2\r\n5\r\n7\r\n2\r\n11",
