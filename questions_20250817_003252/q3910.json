  "text": "Finite fieldsonly exist when the order (size) is a prime powerpk(where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer). For each prime power, there is a finite field with this size, and all fields of a given order are isomorphic.Finite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebraic geometry, Galois theory, finite geometry, cryptography and coding theory.InputThe first line contains an integerT, the number of test cases.\r\nOn the nextTlines, you will be given an integerN: a proposed order to be tested.OutputOutputTlines, one for each test case, withp kifNcan be the order of a finite field.pmust be a prime number, andkan integer such thatN=pk.

(Thanks atMin_25for suggesting this constraint). About 50% of input cases are \"Invalid order\".Nis log-uniform distributed between 233333and its square root.\r\nPrime numbers inNdecomposition are almost log-uniform distributed, from 4bit to 128bit. 3 input files.\r\nYou may first tryPRIMEPOWwith easier constraints.Edit(2017-02-11) TL updated ; compiler changes.",
