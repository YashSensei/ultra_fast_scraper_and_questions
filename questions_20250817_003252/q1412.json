  "text": "A network ofmroads connectsNcities (numbered from 1 toN). There may be more than one road connecting one city with another. Some of the roads are paid. There are two ways to pay for travel on a paid roadifrom cityaito citybi:in advance, in a cityci(which may or may not be the same asai);after the travel, in the citybi. The payment isPiin the first case andRiin the second case. Write a program to find a minimal-cost route from the city 1 to the cityN.InputThe first line of the input contains the values ofNandm. Each of the followingmlines describes one road by specifying the values ofai,bi,ci,Pi,Ri(1 ≤ i ≤ m). Adjacent values on the same line are separated by one or more spaces. All values are integers, 1 ≤ m, N ≤ 10, 0 ≤ Pi, Ri ≤ 100, Pi ≤ Ri (1 ≤ i ≤ m).OutputThe first and only line of the output must contain the minimal possible cost of a trip from the city 1 to the cityN. If the trip is not possible for any reason, the line must contain the word 'impossible'.ExampleInput:4 51 2 1 10 102 3 1 30 503 4 3 80 802 1 2 10 101 3 2 10 50Output:110",
