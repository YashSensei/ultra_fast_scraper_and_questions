  "text": "Let's consider the alphabet consisting of the firstcroman uppercase letters, i.e. {A, B, C, D, E, F} ifcis 6.We will call two wordsquite different, if there is no common subsequence of length more than one between those two words. For example ABC and CBA are quite different, but ABBA and CADDCAD aren't, because AA is a subsequence of both words.Given a wordwyou are to find the number of words of lengthnthat are quite different fromw.InputThe first line will contain the number of test cases (at most 20). Then there will be pairs of lines, the first one containing the numbersn(nwill fit into a 32-bit signed integer and will be non-negative) andc(1 ≤c≤ 6), the second one the wordw.wwill only consist of the firstcletters of the roman alphabet and will have at most 10000 characters.OutputPrint one line for each test case, consisting only of the number of words that are quite different fromw. As this number can be quite large, you just have to output its remainder when dividing by 4242.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 3\r\nABC\r\n4 4\r\nCADDCAD\r\n100 3\r\nAOutput:10\r\n13\r\n2223",
