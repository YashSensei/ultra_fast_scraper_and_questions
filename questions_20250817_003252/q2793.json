  "text": "Changu and Mangu are brothers. Changu likes 2 and Mangu likes 3. They decided to express each number as sum of 2 and 3.They need your help. They want you to tell them the number of ways of writing a number as ordered sums of 2 and/or 3.For example, there are 4 ways to write 8 as an ordered sum of 2s and/or 3s:2 + 2 + 2 + 22 + 3 + 33 + 2 + 33 + 3 + 2InputThe first line contains T, the number of test cases. It is followed by T lines, each containing the number N.OutputYou have to print the number of ways of writing N as ordered sum of 2 and/or 3. You have to print the answer mod 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n8Output:1\r\n1\r\n4Constraints:T ≤ 1000001 ≤ N ≤ 1000000",
