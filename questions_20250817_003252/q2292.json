  "text": "Mirko is a strange boy so he has written down a square matrix full of ones and zeroes. Now he is interested in how many plusses there are in his matrix.A plus is a square such that its side has an odd length greater than 1 and all of its cells are zero, except for the middle row and the middle column: they must be full of ones. For example, in the matrix below there are two plusses, one inside the other:0010000100111110010000100InputIn the first line there is an integer N â‰¤ 2000, dimension of the square matrix.The next N lines are the rows of the matrix.OutputPrint the number of plusses appearing in the matrix.ExampleInput:80001000000010000000100001111111100010000000100100001011100010010Output:3",
