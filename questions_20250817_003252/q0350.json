  "text": "A team of speleologists organizes a training in the Great Cave of Byte Mountains.\r\nDuring the training each speleologist explores a route from Top Chamber\r\nto Bottom Chamber. The speleologists may move down only, i.e. the level of every\r\nconsecutive chamber on a route should be lower then the previous one. Moreover, each\r\nspeleologist has to start from Top Chamber through a different corridor and each of them must enter\r\nBottom Chamber using different corridor. The remaining corridors may be traversed by\r\nmore than one speleologist. How many speleologists can train\r\nsimultaneously?TaskWrite a program which:reads the cave description from the standard input,computes the maximal number of speleologists that may train simultaneously,writes the result to the standard output.InputThe number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line.\r\nIn the first line of each test case there is one integern(2 ≤ n ≤ 200), equal to the number of chambers in the cave. The chambers are\r\nnumbered with integers from1tonin descending level order - the chamber of\r\ngrater number is at the higher level than the chamber of the lower one. (Top\r\nChamber has number1,and Bottom Chamber has numbern). In the followingn-1lines\r\n(i.e. lines2, 3 ... n) the descriptions of corridors are given. The (i+1)-th\r\nline contains numbers of chambers connected by corridors with thei-th chamber. (only\r\nchambers with numbers grater theniare mentioned). The first number in a line,m,0 ≤ m ≤(n-i+1), is a number of corridors exiting the chamber being described.\r\nThen the followingmintegers are the numbers of\r\nthe chambers the corridors are leading to.OutputYour program should write one integer for each test case.\r\nThis number should be equal to the maximal number of\r\nspeleologists able to train simultaneously.ExampleInput:1\r\n12\r\n4 3 4 2 5\r\n1 8\r\n2 9 7\r\n2 6 11\r\n1 8\r\n2 9 10\r\n2 10 11\r\n1 12\r\n2 10 12\r\n1 12\r\n1 12Output:3The sample input corresponds to the following cave:",
