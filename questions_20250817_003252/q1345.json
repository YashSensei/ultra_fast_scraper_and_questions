Given an interval [l, r], calculate how many beautiful numbers n satisfy l ≤ n ≤ r.InputFirst line, the number of test cases, t.Then t lines follow, each line two numbers l, r, representing the query interval [l, r].1 ≤ t ≤ 2.5×1041 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018Outputt lines. The t-th line is the answer to the t-th query.ExampleInput:1\r\n1 100Output:33",
