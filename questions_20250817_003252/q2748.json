  "text": "Given a positive integerN, consider any permutation of all the numbers from1toN. It is required to create two partitions,P1andP2, from these numbers such that|sum(P1) – sum(P2)|is minimum, wheresum(X)denotes the summation of all the numbers in partitionX. A partition is defined to be a non-empty subset of the permutation. In other words, find the minimum absolute difference between the summation of all the numbers in each partition. Note that you cannot leave out any number, every number from1toNmust be part of exactly one partition.InputThe first line contains an integerT, denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next subsequentTlines contain a positive integerN.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 10002 ≤ N ≤ 109OutputFor each test case, first print the case number followed by the minimum absolute difference.Sample Input5\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6Sample OutputCase 1: 1\r\nCase 2: 0\r\nCase 3: 0\r\nCase 4: 1\r\nCase 5: 1ChallengeTry the harder version here:Bipartite Permutation (Hard)",
