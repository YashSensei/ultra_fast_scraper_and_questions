  "text": "A farmer has a set of fields, each of which is surrounded by cypress trees. Also, the farmer\r\nhas a set of strips of land, each of which has a row of cypress trees. In both fields and strips,\r\nbetween every two consecutive cypress trees is a single olive tree. All of the farmer’s\r\ncypress trees either surround a field or are in a strip and all of the farmer’s olive trees are\r\nbetween two consecutive cypress trees in a field or in a strip.One day the farmer became very ill and he felt that he was going to die. A few days before\r\nhe passed away he called his eldest son and told him, “I give you any Q cypress trees of\r\nyour choice and all the olive trees which are between any two consecutive cypress trees you\r\nhave chosen.” From each field and from each strip the son can pick any combination of\r\ncypress trees. Since the eldest son loves olives he wants to pick the Q cypress trees which\r\nwill allow him to inherit as many olive trees as possible.In Figure 1, assume that the son is given Q = 17 cypress trees. To maximize his olive\r\ninheritance he should choose all the cypress trees in Field 1 and Field 2, inheriting 17 olive\r\ntrees.You are to write a program which, given the information about the fields and the strips and\r\nthe number of cypress trees the son can pick, determines the largest possible number of\r\nolive trees the son may inherit.Inputt - the number of test cases [t ≤ 20], then t test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains first the integer Q: the number of cypress trees the son is to select; then the integer M, the number of fields; and then the integer K, the number of strips.The second line contains M integers N1, N2… NM: the numbers of cypress trees in fields.The third line contains K integers R1, R2… RK: the numbers of cypress trees in strips.In all test cases:0 ≤ Q ≤ 1500000 ≤ M ≤ 20000 ≤ K ≤ 20003 ≤ Ni≤ 1502 ≤ Ri≤ 150The total number of cypress trees in the fields and strips is at least Q. Additionally, in 50% of the test cases, Q ≤ 1500.OutputFor each test case output one integer: largest possible number of olive trees the son may inherit.ExampleInput:1\r\n17 3 3 \r\n13 4 8 \r\n4 8 6Output:17",
