  "text": "Tracy is teaching Charlie maths via a game called N-Cube, which involves three sections involving N.Tracy gives Charlie a number N, and Charlie makes a list of Nthpowers of integers in increasing order (1N, 2N, 3N... and so on). This teaches him exponentiation.Then Charlie performs the following subtraction game N times: Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. E.g., if N was 6, the list proceeds as [1, 64, 729, 4096 ... ] to [63, 685, 3367 ...], and so on 5 more times.After the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the Nth element of the list. This number is thevalue of the game.After practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbersM(where M is a prime) andRinstead of just a single number N, and the game must start fromMR- 1instead of N. Since thevalue of the gamecan now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer K such that MKdivides this number. Since even K can be large, output K modulo 1000000007 (109+7).InputFirst line will containT, number of test cases. ThenTtest cases follow. Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integersM R.OutputFor each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Charlie to Tracy modulo 1000000007.Constraints1 <= T <= 10002 <= M <= 109, M is a prime number1 <= R <= 109ExampleInput1\r\n2 2Output:1ExplanationThis list is: [1, 8, 27, 64, 125...] → [7, 19, 37, 61...] → [12, 18, 24...] → [6, 6, 6...]. Number of times 2 divides 6 is 1. Hence the answer is 1.",
