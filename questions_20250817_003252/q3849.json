  "text": "Little Tulip recently learnt about how to  write numbers. So she wrote some numbers in a paper in a line. But she never wrote a number which is less than the prevous one.Now she want to know how many different numbers are in a given range.In short, you are given an array of N integers indexed from 1 to N, and q queries, each in the form i j, you have to find the number of distinct integers from index i to j (inclusive).InputInput starts with an integer T (≤ 15), denoting the number of test cases.The first line of a case is a blank line. The next line contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5), q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5). The next line contains N space separated positive integers forming the array. Each of the next q lines will contain a query which is in the form i j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N).OutputFor each test case, print the case number in a single line. Then for each query you have to print a line containing number of distinct integers from index i to j.ExampleInput:2\r\n\r\n5 3\r\n1 2 2 4 5\r\n1 2\r\n1 5\r\n4 5\r\n\r\n3 1\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 3Output:Case 1:\r\n2\r\n4\r\n2\r\nCase 2:\r\n1",
