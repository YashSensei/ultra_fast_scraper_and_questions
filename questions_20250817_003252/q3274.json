The following N lines contain the integers of the sequence in order.OutputPrint a single integer representing the number of increasing subsequences of S of length K, modulo 5,000,000.ExampleInput:4 3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n10Output:2The two 3-tuples are (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4), both corresponding to the subsequence 1, 2, 10.",
