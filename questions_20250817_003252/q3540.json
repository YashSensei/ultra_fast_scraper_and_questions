  "text": "Farmer John is going to build a new rectangular barn. But the 4 corners of the barn mustn't be on soft soil. He examined the ground and found that there are only N (4 <= N <= 1,000) appropriate points for the corners. He wants to know the number of possible ways to build the new barn.Given the points, help him find the answer.Input:Input exactly contains 10 test cases each of them as follows:Line 1: A single integer, N.Lines 2..N+1: Each line has two space-separated integers x, y which are the coordinates of a point. The magnitude of the coordinates is not more than 16,000. All points will be distinct.Output:For each Test case print one line contains:Line 1: The number of possible ways to build the new barn.Sample:Input8\r\n1 2\r\n1 -2\r\n2 1\r\n2 -1\r\n-1 2\r\n-1 -2\r\n-2 1\r\n-2 -1\r\n[and 9 more Test cases ...]Output6\r\n[and 9 more Test cases ...]Output Details:The possible answers are: {1, 2, 6, 5}, {1, 3, 6, 8}, {1, 4, 6, 7}, {2, 3, 5, 8}, {2, 4, 5, 7}, {3, 4, 8, 7}",
