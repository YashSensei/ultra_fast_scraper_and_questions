You know, the wooden hollow dolls of\ndifferent sizes of which the smallest doll is contained in the second smallest,\nand this doll is in turn contained in the next one and so forth. One day he\nwonders if there is another way of nesting them so he will end up with\nfewer nested dolls? After all, that would make his collection even\nmore magnificent! He unpacks each nested doll and measures the width\nand height of each contained doll. A doll with width w1 and height h1 will\nfit in another doll of width w2 and height h= if and only if w1 < w2 and\nh1 < h2. Can you help him calculate the smallest number of nested dolls\npossible to assemble from his massive list of measurements?InputOn the first line of input is a single positive integer 1 ≤ t ≤ 20 specifying\nthe number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a positive\ninteger 1 ≤ m ≤ 20000 on a line of itself telling the number of dolls\nin the test case. Next follow 2m positive integers w1, h1, w2, h2, ... wm,\nhm, where wi is the width and hi is the height of doll number i.\n1 ≤ wi, hi ≤ 10000 for all i.OutputFor each test case there should be one line of output containing the minimum\nnumber of nested dolls possible.SampleInput:4\n3\n20 30 40 50 30 40\n4\n20 30 10 10 30 20 40 50\n3\n10 30 20 20 30 10\n4\n10 10 20 30 40 50 39 51Output:1\n2\n3\n2",
