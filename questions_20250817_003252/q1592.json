  "text": "InputThe input is a directed (multi)graph.The first line gives the number of edges M and the number of nodes N (â‰¥ 2). Then each edge is described by a line of the form \"FROM TO LABEL\". Nodes (FROM, TO) are numbers in the range 0 .. N-1 and labels are also numbers.All numbers in the input are non-negative integers less then 2000.OutputPrint \"YES\" if there are two distinct walks with the same labelling from node 0 to node 1, otherwise print \"NO\".Example 1Input:4 40 2 00 3 02 1 13 1 2Output:NOExample 2Input:10 90 2 02 1 02 3 03 4 04 2 02 5 05 6 06 7 07 8 08 2 0Output:YESIn this case the shortest labelling that appears on two walks is 0 repeated 10 times.",
