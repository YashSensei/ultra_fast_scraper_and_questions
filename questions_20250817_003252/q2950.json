  "text": "Almost Prime Numbers are composite numbers which are not divisible by certain prime numbers. Given K prime numbers and an integer N, find out the number of Almost Prime Numbers (i.e. composite numbers not divisible by any of the given K prime numbers) that are not greater than N.InputFirst line of input consists of an integerT (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000), denoting the number of test cases. ThenTtest cases follow. Each case begins with a line containing two integersN (0 ≤ N ≤ 106)andK (1 ≤ K ≤ 10). The next line containsKspace separated prime numbers. All the prime numbers are guaranteed to beless than 50.OutputFor each test case, output a single line in the formatCase X: Y, whereXdenotes the test case number andYdenotes the number of Almost Prime Numbers that are not greater than N.ExampleInput:2\r\n1000 3\r\n2 3 5\r\n49 3\r\n2 3 5Output:Case 1: 100\r\nCase 2: 1",
