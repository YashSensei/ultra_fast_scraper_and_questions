  "text": "Today Mary's math homework is to solve an equation.k1x1p1+ \r\nk2x2p2+ ... +\r\nknxnpn= 0She knows all kiand pi, and 1 ≤ xi≤ M. All ximust be integers. She must work out the number of different solutions of this equation this day. Can you give her a hand?InputThere is a single integer T in the very first line of the input denoted the number of tests. T blocks follow.For each test case:The first line contains a single integer n (n ≤ 6). The second line contains a single integer m (m ≤ 150). n lines follow, each contains two space-separated integers kiand pi, i = 1, 2 ... n. All piare positive.|k1Mp1| + \r\n|k2Mp2| + ... +\r\n|knMpn| < 231OutputFor each test case output a single line, which contains a single integer - the answer. You may assume this number is less than 231.ExampleInput:1\r\n3\r\n150\r\n1 2\r\n-1 2\r\n1 2Output:178Warning: The time limit is very strict for this problem.",
