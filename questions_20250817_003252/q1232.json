  "text": "In the zoo there are N cages in which we keep N snakes: each snake in its cage. For experimental reasons, in a month we will move each snake to a different cage: this reordering is given in the input.Each cage is illuminated by special light, which may be of type A, type B or type C. Your task is to assign the lights A, B, C to the cages so that:each snake will change its lighting, i.e. it will be moved to the cage illuminated differently from the cage it currently inhabits;lightings are equally distributed, i.e. the number of cages A, the number of cages B and the number of cages C differ by at most one.InputThe first line contains an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 300 000), the number of snakes and cages. Cages are numbered from 1 to N.Each of the next N lines contains an integer. When K-th of these lines contains the number L, it means that the snake from the cage K will be moved to the cage L (K ≠ L). Two snakes will not move to the same cage.OutputPrint the string composed of the characters A, B and C, such that the K-th character denotes the lighting of the cage K. If there are multiple solutions, print any.ExampleInput:4\r\n4\r\n3\r\n2\r\n1Output:ACBC",
