  "text": "You are given an unweighted, undirected treeT.\r\nWe sayTis special iff it has this property:\"All nodes of degree greater than or equal to 3 are surrounded by at most two nodes of degree two or greater.\"Finding maximal size subtree of this tree so that it's a special tree.InputThe first line of the input file contains one integerN– number of nodes in the tree\r\n(0 <N≤ 106). NextN-1 lines containN-1 edges of that tree – Each line contains a pair (u,v) means\r\nthere is an edge between nodeuand nodev(1 ≤u,v≤N).OutputAt the first line, output number of nodes in the optimal subtree you found.\r\nNext lines, print all edges belong to that subtree, each line contains a pairuvmeans an edge between nodeuand nodev.ExampleInput:5\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n2 4\r\n2 5Output:5\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n2 4\r\n2 5",
