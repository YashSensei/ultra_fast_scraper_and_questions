BuggyD observes that a stringxcan have many maximal upsubsequences.  Help him find all the maximal upsubsequences inx.InputThe first line of the input contains an integert, the number of test cases.ttest cases follow.Each test case consists of a single line containing a stringx, where the length ofxis no more than 100.xwill not contain any spaces, tabs or other whitespace characters.OutputFor each test case, output all of the maximal upsubsequences ofxin lexicographical order.  Print a blank line after each test case.ExampleInput:1\r\nabcbcbcdOutput:abbbcd\r\nabbccd\r\nabcccd",
