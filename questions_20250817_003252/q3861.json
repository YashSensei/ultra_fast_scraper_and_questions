  "text": "Let's deal with an array again, the most important data structure of computer science. You will be given an array. Now you have some operations to do. There will be three types of operations:Type 1: Insert a number after a given indexType 2: Change the value of an index.Type 3: You will get a number and two indices i and j where i ≤ j. You have to answer how many time the number appears in the array starting from i to j.InputEach file contains one test case.The first line contains an integer N, the number of initial array elements (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and Q, the number of queries (1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000). Second line contains N integers each in the range from 1 to 100000. Each of the next Q lines contains an operation. The operations will appear as the formats below:1 x y, where 1 ≤ x ≤ length of the array, which means you have to insert number y after the index x.2 x y, For this operation, you have to change the value of index x to value y.3 i j x, Here, you have to find how many times x appears in the array from i to j. Here x will always be present in the array and 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ length the array.OutputFor each operation of 3rd type, output the required answer in separate line.ExampleInput:5 342 18468 6335 26501 191702 4 293592 5 57063 2 5 5706Output:1",
