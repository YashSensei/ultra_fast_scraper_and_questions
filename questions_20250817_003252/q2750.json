  "text": "In this problem you are given a pizza. You have to find the maximum number of slices after cutting the pizzaexactly Ntimes.Note that it is not necessary to make each slice equal.For example ifN = 1then we can make maximum 2 slices. Figure 1 show this.IfN = 2then we can make maximum 4 slices. Figure 2 show this.InputInput starts with an integerT (1 ≤ 106), denoting the number of test cases.Each case contains an integerN (1 ≤ N ≤ 109)denoting the number of times you can cut the pizza.OutputFor each case of input, output only one integer themaximum number of slices.ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n2Output:2\r\n4",
