  "text": "Given 2 points in 2 dimensional space (xs, ys) and (xd, yd), your task is to find whether (xd, yd) can be reached from (xs, ys) by making a sequence of zero or more operations.From a given point (x, y), the operations possible are:Move to point (y, x)Move to point (x, -y)Move to point (x + y, y)Move to point (2 * x, y)InputThe first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, one for each test case. For each test case, the input contains one line denoting the 4 integers xs, ys, xd, ydOutputOutput T lines, one for each test case. For each test case, output \"YES\" if (xd, yd) is reachable from (xs, ys) and \"NO\" otherwise. (quotes for clarity)ExampleInput:1\r\n1 1 2 2Output:YESConstraintsT ≤ 25-1010≤ xs, ys, xd, yd ≤ 1010Note that, although the input values are constrained by the above inequality, the coordinates of the points\r\nat the intermediate steps need not be.ExplanationTest case 1: We can move in the following manner: (1,1) → (2,1), using the operation (x, y) → (2 * x, y). Then, move from (2, 1) → (1, 2), using the operation (x, y) → (y, x). Finally use the operation (x, y) → (2 * x, y) to move from (1, 2) → (2, 2).",
