  "text": "Consider a maze consisting of 3 rows of n square blocks each. The passageways \r\n\tin every block match one of three possible patterns, numbered 0 (empty), 1 \r\n\t(straight) and 2 (bent), as depicted below.Your task is to determine whether it is possible to create a passage in a given \r\n\tmaze, with an entrance at the left end and an outlet at the right end of the \r\n\tmaze, only by rotating some of the squares of the maze by a multiple of 90 \r\n\tdegrees.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n - the number of \r\n\tsquares in one row of the maze (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). The next n lines \r\n\tcontain three integers each, denoting the types of blocks in consecutive \r\n\tcolumns of the maze. A column description is of the forma b c(0 ≤a, b, c≤ 2), \r\n\twherearepresents the type of the block in the first row,b- in \r\n\tthe second row andc- in the third row.OutputFor each test case output the wordyesif it is possible to rotate the squares so as to form a connection between the \r\n\tleft and right edge, and the wordnoin the opposite case.ExampleInput:1\r\n6\r\n1 0 1\r\n1 2 2\r\n2 2 1\r\n2 2 1\r\n2 2 1\r\n1 2 2Output:yesIndeed, the sample input corresponds to the following maze:for which there exists a correct solution to the problem:Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
