  "text": "There are given n isosceles right triangles on a plane. Each triangle can be described by three integers x, y, m (m > 0). Vertices of such a triangle are points which have coordinates (x; y), (x+m; y) and (x; y+m).Write a program which calculates the total area covered by triangles.InputThe first line of the input contains one positive integer n (n ≤ 2000), the number of triangles on a plane.The next n lines of the file describe the triangles, one triangle per line. Each line contains three integers xi, yiand mi, separated by single spaces (1 ≤ i ≤ n, ‑107≤ xi≤ 107, ‑107≤ yi≤ 107, 0 < mi≤ 1000).OutputOn the first line of the output one number with exactly one digit after decimal point must be written – the total area covered by triangles.ExampleInput:5\r\n-5 -3 6\r\n-1 -2 3\r\n 0 0 2\r\n-2 2 1\r\n-4 -1 2Output:24.5",
