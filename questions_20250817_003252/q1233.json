  "text": "Sir Chirag is famous for his 'Intelligencia\". He found thatDukkarandChaptawere unable to solve a question.The magic Numbers are described as: The numbers are strictly positive, don't contain any leading zeroes. It has exactly 'p' digits and if we move the last digit of the number to the beginning, it grows exactly 'x' times.Chirag Sir took the task to solve it. It took him minutes to solve. Now its your turn.You have to find the minimum possible number that satisfies the above conditions given 'p' and 'x'.InputFirst line contains the number of test cases T: 0 < T <= 50Next T lines contains two integerspandx, 0 < p <= 1000000 and 0 < x < 10.OutputIf such a number is not possible then print \"Impossible\" (Without the quotes). Else print the number.ExampleInput:3\r\n6 5\r\n1 2\r\n6 4Output:142857\r\nImpossible\r\n102564(observe that for the first test case : 142857 x 5 = 714285)",
