It is not mandatory to delete character.For example: S =aXband T =Yab. Now, if we delete X from S and Y from T, then total cost = 15 + 30 = 45. \r\nAnd S and T will becomeab.Another example: S =ab, T =cd, Now total cost = 15 + 15 + 30 + 30 = 90.Another example: S =abcd, T =acdb, Now total cost = 15 + 30 = 45.InputInput consists of pairs of lines. The first line of a pair contains the first stringSand the second line contains the second stringT. Each string is on a separate line and consists of at most 1,000 characters . The end of input occurs when the first sequence starts with an \"#\" character (without the quotes).OutputFor each subsequent pair of input lines, output a line containing one integer number which the minimum cost to make the string equal (same).Sample Input/OutputSample InputSample Outputaxb\r\nyab\r\nab\r\ncd\r\nko\r\np\r\nabcd\r\nacdb\r\n#45\r\n90\r\n60\r\n45___________________________________________________________________________________________________________Problem Setter: Shipu Ahamed, Dept. of CSEBangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT)",
