(1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)Then follows n lines every line has three integersXi Yi Riindicates the coordinate of the center of the circle, and the radius. (|Xi|. |Yi| ≤ 1000, Ri ≤ 1000)Note that in this problem Ri may be 0 and it just means one point !OutputThe total area that these N circles with 3 digits after decimal pointExampleInput:3\r\n0 0 10 0 1100 100 1Output:6.283",
