  "text": "The SUM problem can be formulated as follows: given four lists A, B, C, D  of integer values, compute how many quadruplet (a, b, c, d ) belongs to A x B x C x D  are such that a + b + c + d = 0. In the following, assume that all lists have the same size n.InputThe first line of the input file contains the size of the lists n (this value can be as large as 4000). We then have n lines containing four integer values (with absolute value as large as 228) that belong respectively to A, B, C and D.(Edited:n â‰¤ 2500)OutputOutput should be printed on a single line.ExampleInput:6\r\n-45 22 42 -16\r\n-41 -27 56 30\r\n-36 53 -37 77\r\n-36 30 -75 -46\r\n26 -38 -10 62\r\n-32 -54 -6 45Output:5",
