  "text": "n persons are standing in a line. Height of each person is between 1 and n and height of each person is distinct.You a given array A where A[i] denotes how many persons are before i'th person having heights greater than H[i]. eg. For person 2, person 1 is considered before him. If A is given to be [0, 1] then one valid arrangements of height could be [2, 1] as number of persons having height greater than 1 before 2 are 1 because H[1] > H[2].You have to find out whether this array can be valid for some arrangement of persons. If you can uniquely do so, then find out the array H. Otherwise output -1.InputFirst line contains T : number of test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 20).For each test First line contains an integer n. (1 ≤ n ≤ 105)Next line contains n space separated integers denoting A[i]. (0 ≤ A[i] ≤ n)OutputFor each test case output single lineIf there is a unique way of H. Then print n space separated integers in the line.Otherwise output -1.In starting of each test case also put \"Test : testNumber\" (without quotes). Note that there is one space before the colon and one space after the colon.ExampleInput:230 1 130 1 0Output:Test : 13 1 2Test : 22 1 3",
