  "text": "Farmer John has N (1 ≤ N ≤ 25,000) rectangular barns on his farm, all\r\nwith sides parallel to the X and Y axes and integer corner coordinates in\r\nthe range 0..1,000,000. These barns do not overlap although they may\r\nshare corners and/or sides with other barns.Since he has extra cows to milk this year, FJ would like to expand some of\r\nhis barns.  A barn has room to expand if it does not share a corner or a\r\nwall with any other barn.  That is, FJ can expand a barn if all four of its\r\nwalls can be pushed outward by at least some amount without bumping into\r\nanother barn.  If two barns meet at a corner, neither barn can expand.Please determine how many barns have room to expand.Inputt – the number of test cases, then t test cases follow.Each test case takes the following form:The first line contains the number of rectangular barns - n.Each of the next n lines contains:Four space-separated integers A, B, C, and D,      describing one barn. The lower-left corner of the barn is at (A, B) and the upper right corner is at (C, D).OutputFor each test case write a single integer that is the number of barns that can be expanded in a separate lineExampleInput:1\r\n5\r\n0 2 2 7\r\n3 5 5 8\r\n4 2 6 4\r\n6 1 8 6\r\n0 0 8 1Output:2Input/Output details:There are 5 barns.  The first barn has its lower-left corner at (0, 2) and\r\nits upper-right corner at (2, 7), and so on.Only two barns can be expanded --- the first two listed in the input.\r\nAll other barns are each in contact with at least one other barn.",
