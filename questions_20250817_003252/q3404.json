  "text": "My birthday is coming up and traditionally I'm serving pie. Not just\r\none pie, no, I have a numberNof them, of various tastes and\r\nof various sizes.Fof my friends are coming to my party and\r\neach of them gets a piece of pie. This should be one piece of one pie,\r\nnot several small pieces since that looks messy. This piece can be one\r\nwhole pie though.My friends are very annoying and if one of them gets a bigger piece\r\nthan the others, they start complaining. Therefore all of them should\r\nget equally sized (but not necessarily equally shaped) pieces, even if\r\nthis leads to some pie getting spoiled (which is better than spoiling\r\nthe party).  Of course, I want a piece of pie for myself too, and that\r\npiece should also be of the same size.What is the largest possible piece size all of us can get?  All the\r\npies are cylindrical in shape and they all have the same height 1,\r\nbut the radii of the pies can be different.InputOne line with a positive integer: the number of test cases. Then\r\nfor each test case:One line with two integersNandFwith 1 ≤N, F≤ 10000: the number of pies and the number of\r\nfriends.One line withNintegersriwith 1 ≤ri≤ 10000: the radii of the pies.OutputFor each test case, output one line with the largest possible volumeVsuch that me and my friends can all get a pie piece of sizeV.  The answer should be given as a floating point number\r\nwith an absolute error of at most 10-3.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 3\r\n4 3 3\r\n1 24\r\n5\r\n10 5\r\n1 4 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 2Output:25.1327\r\n3.1416\r\n50.2655",
