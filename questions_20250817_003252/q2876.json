I have an awesome task with chameleons, 5thtask for Saturday’s competition.\"\"Go ahead...\"(...)“That’s too difficult, I have an easier one, they won’t even solve that one.”“You are given an array of N integers from the interval [1, K]. You need to process M queries. The first\r\ntype of query requires you to change a number in the array to a different value, and the second type of\r\nquery requires you to determine the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of the current array that\r\ncontains all numbers from 1 to K.”“Hm, I can do it in O(N6). What’s the limit for N?”InputThe first line of input contains the integers N, K and M (1 <= N, M <= 100 000, 1 <= K <= 50). The\r\nsecond line of input contains N integers separated by space, the integers from the array. After that,\r\nM queries follow, each in one of the following two forms:“1 p v” - change the value of the pthnumber into v (1 <= p <= N, 1 <= v <= K)“2” - what is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray of the array containing all the integers from 1 to KOutputThe output must consist of the answers to the queries of the second type, each in its own line.If the required subarray doesn’t exist, output −1.ExampleInput:4 3 5\r\n2 3 1 2\r\n2\r\n1 3 3\r\n2\r\n1 1 1\r\n2Output:3\r\n-1\r\n4",
