  "text": "Gopi is fond of sandwiches. Once his friend asks him to give part of his sandwich. But, Gopi wants to give him as little sandwich as possible. So, he devises a method.He divides the sandwich intonparts, where each part is a unit fraction (fractions of the form1/pwhere p is integer) of the original sandwich. Among all these parts he chooses the smallest part and gives it to his friend. Help Gopi to find the smallest part possible.InputFirst line containst (1 ≤ t ≤ 105)the number of test cases. The nexttlines contain one integer per line denotingn (2 ≤ n ≤ 106)the number of parts the sandwich can be divided.OutputOutput one line per test case containing the denominator of the smallest part. Since, the answer can be very large, print the answermodulo 109+ 7.ExampleInput:1\r\n3Output:6Explanation:The possible ways of dividing the sandwich into 3 parts are:1/3, 1/3, 1/31/6, 1/2, 1/31/4, 1/4, 1/2Among these, the second way has the smallest part. Hence the output is6.",
