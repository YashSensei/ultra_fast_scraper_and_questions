  "text": "The task is simply to find LIS and number of way we can select distinct LISLIS (short for Longest Increasing Subsequence) is the longest subsequence of the sequence in which every element in the subsequence is increasing.A LIS is distinct when one of the element come from different index of the beginning array.This task involves finding length of Longest IS and number of ways LIS can be made.InputFirst line: integerNrepresent number of elements in the sequenceN <= 100000.Second line:Nintegers represent number in the sequence, each integer is in the range [1, 100000000].Output2 integer in 1 line, Length of LIS and Number of LIS that can be made.The answers can be very large, so print both answers mod 1000000007.ExamplesInput:5\r\n1 3 2 5 4Output:3 4Input:5\r\n1 2 5 3 3Output:3 3ExplanationIn the first test case, the subsequence are (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 4).\r\n\r\nIn the second test case, the subsequence are (1, 2, 5), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3). Note that there are two 3s in the sequence which both count separately.",
