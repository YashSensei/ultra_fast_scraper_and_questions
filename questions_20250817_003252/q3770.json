  "text": "Fruit Ninja is a juicy action game enjoyed by millions of players around the world, with squishy, splat and satisfying fruit carnage! Become the ultimate bringer of sweet, tasty destruction with every slash.--- WikipediaIt is a very popular game on cell phones where people can enjoy cutting the fruit by touching the screen. The screen is rectangular, and all the fruit can be considered as circles, with coordinate of the center, and radius. Note that the fruit may overlap with each other. In this problem, a touch is a straight line cutting through the whole screen, scoring all the fruits it cuts or touches.Now Fred is playing the Fruit Ninja, and seems absorbed in the game. He's desperate to create a new record, so he asks you for help. Now you are given a screen shot of the game, help him find the highest score he can get in a single touch.InputThe first line contains an integerT(1 ≤T≤ 50), indicating the number of test cases.Each test case contains several lines.\r\nThe first line contains an integerN(1 ≤N≤ 1000), indicating the number of fruit.The followingNlines each contains three integersXi,Yi,Ri(-1000 ≤X,Y≤ 1000, 1 ≤Ri≤ 1000), representing a fruit on the screen, where (X,Y) is the coordinate of the center of the fruit, andRiis the radius.You can assume the screen is infinite.OutputFor each test case in the input, print one line:\"Case #X: Y\", whereXis the test case number (starting with 1) andYis maximum number of fruit that you can cut in a single touch.It is guaranteed that the answer will remain the same even if you expand the radius of all the fruit slightly by 10-5.ExampleInput:2\r\n4\r\n-2 5 1\r\n5 5 1\r\n-3 2 1\r\n0 1 1\r\n4\r\n-4 5 1\r\n3 2 1\r\n-5 3 1\r\n4 -3 1Output:Case #1: 3\r\nCase #2: 2",
