  "text": "Let us consider the set of integer numbers between 1 and N inclusive. Order them lexicographically (i. e. like in the vocabulary), for example, for  N = 11 the order would be: 1, 10, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.Denote the position of the number K in this ordering as QN,K.  For example, Q11,2= 4.Given N and K, compute QN,K.InputThe first line contains a number T, which is the number of test cases. T lines follow, each contains 2 integers N and K separated by a single space.OutputFor each test case, print QN,Kon a single line.Constraint1 ≤ T ≤ 1001 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10100ExampleInput:71 111 2215 211215 215215 26215 991000000000 999999999Output:141261301352151000000000",
