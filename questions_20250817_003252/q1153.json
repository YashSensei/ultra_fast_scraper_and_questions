  "text": "You’re in charge of designing a campus network between buildings and are very worried about its\r\nreliability and its cost. So, you’ve decided to build some redundancy into your network while keeping it\r\nas inexpensive as possible. Specifically, you want to build the cheapest network so that if any one line\r\nis broken, all buildings can still communicate. We’ll call this aminimal reliable net.InputThere will be multiple test cases for this problem. Each test case will start with a pair of integers n (<=15) and m (<= 20) on a line indicating the number of buildings (numbered 1 through n) and the\r\nnumber of potential inter-building connections, respectively. (Values of n = m = 0 indicate the end of\r\nthe problem.) The following m lines are of the form b1b2c (all positive integers) indicating that it costs\r\nc to connect building b1and b2. All connections are bidirectional.OutputFor each test case you should print one line giving the cost of a minimal reliable net. If there is a\r\nminimal reliable net, the output line should be of the form:The minimal cost for test case p is c.wherepis the number of the test case (starting at 1) andcis the cost. If there is no reliable net possible,\r\noutput a line of the form:There is no reliable net possible for test case p.ExampleInput:4 5\r\n1 2 1\r\n1 3 2\r\n2 4 2\r\n3 4 1\r\n2 3 1\r\n2 1\r\n1 2 5\r\n0 0Output:The minimal cost for test case 1 is 6.\r\nThere is no reliable net possible for test case 2.",
