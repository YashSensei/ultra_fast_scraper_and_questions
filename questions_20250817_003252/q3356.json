  "text": "According to Wikipedia, image processing is any form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as photographs or frames of video; the output of image processing can be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. Most image-processing techniques involve treating the image as a two-dimensional signal and applying standard signal-processing techniques to it.The task you are facing here is a relatively easy one (compared to our general conception of image processing!). Given a black-and-white image of size R × C with some digits (and possibly other shapes) on it, your program needs to figure out the digits written on the image. Specifically, the digits drawn on the graph will adhere to the following rules:1) Digits are drawn with a series ofstrokes. Astrokecan be regarded as arectangleof any size on the image, and its edges will always be parallel to eitherx-axisory-axis. The number of strokes required to draw each digit will be exactly as follows:0 \t1 \t2 \t3 \t4 \t5 \t6 \t7 \t8 \t9\r\n4 \t1 \t5 \t4 \t3 \t5 \t5 \t2 \t5 \t5Refer to thefigure belowif you are unclear about how the digits are drawn.2) Although thewidthof strokes used to draw a digit might bedifferent, theouter shapes of digitswill strictly follow those specified in thefigure below.3) In order for a digit to be recognizable,allparts (strokesandjoints) presented in the graph below must also be clearlydistinguishablein the image.(Refer to the last sample test case if you are unsure about this requirement; in that test case, when the middle stroke of 2 is omitted, the number should not be considered as recognizable.)4) You may assume that the image is not rotated, and there isno noisein the input.Please output the sum of digits recognizable in the graph. In the case that no characters is recognizable, please output 0 instead.InputThere are multiple test cases in the input file.Each test case starts with two integers, R and C (1 ≤ R, C ≤ 500), specifying the number of rows / columns of the graph. Each of the following R lines contains consecutive C characters (\"0\" or \"1\"), describing the image to be processed.Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with R = 0, C = 0 indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.OutputFor each test case, please print a single integer, the sum of recognizable numbers. See the sample output for format details.ExampleInput:5 12\r\n001101011111\r\n000101000011\r\n000101001111\r\n001101000011\r\n000000000111\r\n\r\n5 3\r\n111\r\n010\r\n110\r\n010\r\n110\r\n\r\n6 14\r\n11111000011111\r\n11001000000011\r\n11111001000000\r\n11111001001110\r\n11001011001010\r\n11111000001110\r\n\r\n5 2\r\n11\r\n01\r\n11\r\n01\r\n11\r\n\r\n6 9\r\n111100111\r\n000100001\r\n000100011\r\n011100010\r\n010000011\r\n011110000\r\n\r\n0 0Output:Case #1: 4\r\nCase #2: 0\r\nCase #3: 15\r\nCase #4: 3\r\nCase #5: 2",
