  "text": "A range [L..H] is called a K-Frequent Prime range if there are at least K primes amongst the numbers L, L+1 ... H. Given N and K, calculate how many subranges of the range [2..N] are K-Frequent Prime.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains 2 integers N and K.OutputOutput T lines, one corresponding to each test case, containing the required answer.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1002 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 ≤ K ≤ 10000ExampleInput:4\r\n2 1\r\n5 2\r\n5 1\r\n9 3Output:1\r\n4\r\n9\r\n8ExplanationNote: For the first test case, the only valid subrange is [2..2], whereas for the second test case, the valid subranges are: [2..3], [2..4], [2..5], [3..5].",
