  "text": "A positive integer A is called a \"palindrome number\" if the reverse of the decimal representation is the same as the original one. For example 13231 is a palindrome number, but 13333 is not.Given a number A (1 ≤ A ≤ 1e18), find the number of pairs (a, b) such that a and b are both palindrome numbers, and the sum of a and b is A.If A is 391, there are 6 ways:8 + 383 = 391383 + 8 = 39188 + 303 = 391303 + 88 = 39199 + 292 = 391292 + 99 = 391InputThe first Line contains the number of test cases T ≤ 10.\r\nEach test case contains a number A.OutputOutput the number of ways.ExampleInput:1\r\n391Output:6",
