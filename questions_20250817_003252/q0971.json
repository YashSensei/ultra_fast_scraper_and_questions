  "text": "Tim loves spreadsheets. Everything he does on a computer, he does in a spreadsheet. Track his expenses? Create a spreadsheet! Decide which car to buy? Create a spreadsheet to compare them! Make an inventory of his games? Create a spreadsheet! Decide which girl he loves most? …Unfortunately his spreadsheet software just crashed and he needs some of the data right now and does not have the time to install a competing office suit.Given the formulas used in the cells of a spreadsheet, calculate the values of all the cells.InputThe first line of the input file contains an integerTspecifying the number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank line.Each test case starts a single numberNgiving the number of expression. Each of the followingNlines contains a single cell formula of the form “CELL = EXPRESSION”, whereCELLis the name of the cell andEXPRESSIONis a mathematical expression consisting of cell names and the operators +, -, * and /. A cell name is a non-empty sequence of letters followed by a positive integer.Each test case is correct: there are no cycles, and all cells referenced in expressions have definitions.Evaluating expressionsWhen evaluating an expression, usual priorities apply: first we evaluate all * and / (left to right), and only then all + and - (again, left to right).You may assume that the expressions are such that when evaluating the expression in correct order, the result and also all intermediate values will fit into 32-bit signed integer variables.The operator / represents integer division which is always roundeddown. The dividend will always be non-negative and the divisor will always be positive.OutputFor each test case output the calculated values of cells, one per line, in the form “CELL = VALUE”. The rows in the output should be ordered alphabetically. (To compare two rows, take a look at the first character where they differ. The one with a smaller ASCII value goes first.)Optionally, output a blank line between test cases.ExampleInput:23A47 = 5 + ZZ22ZZ22 = 3A9 = 13 + A47 * ZZ222A1 = 4 / 7 + 4 / 7B2 = 3 * 3 / 7Output:A47 = 8A9 = 37ZZ22 = 3A1 = 0B2 = 1",
