  "text": "Pappu was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow. His math’s teacher gives two numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b. Help Pappu with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (number of digits d, such that 1 ≤ d ≤ 1000) and the index b (0 ≤ b ≤ 922×1015). You have to find the last digit of ab.InputThe first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t ≤ 30). t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.OutputFor each test case output an integer per line representing the result.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 10\r\n6 2\r\n150 53Output:9\r\n6\r\n0Source limit is 700 Bytes.",
