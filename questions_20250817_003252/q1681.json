  "text": "You would have been fed up with competitive programming questions so far, now it is time to solve little math.Assume you have a equation A × x - B × y = 0For a given value ofAandB, find the minimum positive integer value ofxandythat satisfies this equation.InputFirst line containsT, number of test cases 0 ≤T≤1000 followed byTlines.First line of each test case contains two space separated integersAandB. 1 ≤A,B≤1 000 000 000.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing two integersxandy(separated by a single space).ExampleInput:1\r\n2 3Output:3 2Note:Brute force won't pass the given constraint.Negative number cases are avoided to make the problem easy.",
