  "text": "Sabbir is a little boy. He loves math very much. One day his friend Taskin gave him a very hard task. Taskin gave himnnumbersa1, a2, a3, ... anTaskin asked for a minimum integer numberx(x > 1) such thatgcd(x, a1) = 1, gcd(x, a2) = 1, ... gcd(x, an) = 1.In other words you have to find a minimum integerx (x > 1 )such that∀i, i ∈ [1...n], gcd(x, ai) = 1Note: gcd is greatest common divisor.InputIn the first line there will be an integerT, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is consists of 2 lines.In the first line there will ben, denoting the number of integers and next line containsnspace separated integersa1, a2, a3, ... an.Constraints1 <= T <= 101 <= n <= 1051 <= ai<= 107Outputfor every case print one integerxin one line.Note:xshould be greater than 1.ExampleInput:3\r\n3\r\n5 7 25\r\n4\r\n1 2 3 4\r\n1\r\n2Output:2\r\n5\r\n3",
