  "text": "Cows have assembled from around the world for a massive gathering. There areNcows, andN−1pairs of cows who are friends with each other. Every cow knows every other cow through some chain of friendships.They had great fun, but the time has come for them to leave, one by one. They want to leave in some order such that as long as there are still at least two cows left, every remaining cow has a remaining friend. Furthermore, due to issues with luggage storage, there areMpairs of cows(ai,bi)such that cowaimust leave before cowbi. Note that the cowsaiandbimay or may not be friends.Help the cows figure out, for each cow, whether she could be the last cow to leave. It may be that there is no way for the cows to leave satisfying the above constraints.InputLine1contains two space-separated integersNandM.Lines2 ≤ i ≤ Neach contain two integersxiandyiwith1 ≤ xi, yi≤ Nandxi≠ yiindicating that cowsxiandyiare friends.LinesN+1 ≤ i ≤ N+Meach contain two integersaiandbiwith1 ≤ ai, bi≤ Nandai≠ biindicating that cowaimust leave the gathering before cowbi.It is guaranteed that1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105.OutputThe output should consist ofNlines, with one integerdion each line such thatdi= 1if cow i could be the last to leave, anddi= 0otherwise.ExampleInput:5 1\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n3 4\r\n4 5\r\n2 4Output:0\r\n0\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1",
