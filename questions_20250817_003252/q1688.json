  "text": "Given an integer N, the number N is called “Psycho Number”. Psycho Number is calculated as follows:First, If we factorize N , then we have some prime and their power. Assume that, there are M powers. From M powers , you should count the number of even and odd powers. Then if the number of even power is strictly greater than odd power, then we call the number N is “Psycho Number”, otherwise the number N is call “Ordinary Number”.As for example, if N = 67500 then prime factorization,67500 = 22x 33x 54.Count even powers and odd powers . This number have 2 even power(2, 4) and 1 odd power (3). Since even power 2 (2, 4) is greater than odd power 1 (3), so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.Input:An integerT(1 ≤T≤ 106) denoting the number of test cases followed by T lines. Each containing a single integerN(1 ≤N≤ 107).Output:For each case print  “Psycho Number” or “Ordinary Number”.SampleSample Input2\r\n3\r\n4Sample OutputOrdinary Number\r\nPsycho NumberNote: 0 and 1 are not a psycho number.Psycho 2:Psycho FunctionPsycho 3:Make PsychoPsycho 4:Psycho34 (easy)Problem setter:Shipu Ahamed, Dept. of CSE,Bangladesh University of Business and Technology (BUBT)[ Edited by EB ]Warning:Some input files are broken.",
