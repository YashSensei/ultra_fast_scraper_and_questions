  "text": "A digit in a number N is a minima if it is less than both the digits adjacent to it. Similarly, a digit is a maxima if it is greater than both the digits adjacent to it. The slope of N is the number of digits in N (leaving out the first and the last digit) which are either a minima or a maxima. Given A and B, count the sum of the slopes of all numbers between A and B.InputThe first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains two integers A and B.OutputOutput T lines one for each test case, containing the required sum for the corresponding test case.SampleInput3\r\n101 101\r\n1 100\r\n100 150Output1\r\n0\r\n19Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 500001 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1000000000000000 (1015)",
