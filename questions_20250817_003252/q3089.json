  "text": "In Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n\r\ncan be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4.\r\nBut these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange\r\nrate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars\r\nyou can get for it?InputThe input will contain several test cases (not more than 10). Each\r\ntest case is a single line with a number n, 0 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 000.\r\nIt is the number written on your coin.OutputFor each test case output a single line, containing the maximum amount\r\nof American dollars you can make.ExampleInput:12\r\n2Output:13\r\n2You can change 12 into 6, 4 and 3, and then change these into\r\n$6+$4+$3 = $13.\r\n\r\nIf you try changing the coin 2 into 3 smaller coins, you will get\r\n1, 0 and 0, and later you can get no more than $1 out of them.\r\nIt is better just to change the 2 coin directly into $2.",
