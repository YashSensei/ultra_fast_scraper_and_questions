  "text": "You will be given anon-negative integer X. You need to performQqueries on that integer. Each query will\r\nconsist of a single decimal digitD. After every query, you need to move all occurrences of digitDin the\r\ninteger to the end, while keeping the relative position of every other digit intact.For example, supposeX = 123123, and supposeQ = 3.For the first query,D = 1, then after the digits are shiftedX = 232311.For the second query,D = 2, then after the digits are shiftedX = 331122.For the third query,D = 3, then after the digits are shiftedX = 112233.After every query, you need to output the value of the integerX. Since it can be really large, output it\r\nmodulo1000000007 (109+ 7).Please note that if at any point after a query,Xcontains leading zeros, then the leading zeros should bediscarded. Therefore, ifX = 2022and ifD = 2, then after the query,Xwill become222.InputThe first line will contain a single integerT (1 ≤ T ≤ 20). Each starts with a single line, which will contain the integerX. Then, in the next line there is a single integerQ (1 ≤ Q ≤ 105), denoting the number of queries. Each of the nextQlines denotes a query, containing a decimal digitD (0 ≤ D ≤ 9). You can safely\r\nassume thatXwon’t contain leading zeros initially and thatXwill never have more than105digits.OutputFor each test case, first print the case number in a single line like“Case V:”. Then for each query, output\r\nthe value ofXmodulo1000000007. Refer to the sample I/O for more clarity.Sample Input1\r\n123123\r\n3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3Sample OutputCase 1:\r\n232311\r\n331122\r\n112233",
