  "text": "To reach the treasure,Joneshas to pass through the\"Room of Death\". The floor of this room is a square with side120units. It is laid with square tiles of dimensions{1 × 1}arranged into a grid. But, at some places in the grid tiles are missing. As soon as the door to this room is opened poisonous gas starts coming out of these missing grid locations. The only escape from this gas is to completely cover these locations with planks lying outside the room. Each plank has dimensions{120 × 1}and can only be placed parallel to either sides of the floor. NowJoneswants to minimize the damage to his health so that he has enough of it left for the treasure. He figures out that in order to achieve this he has to use the minimum number of planks possible. He also realises that even if the planks overlap, poisonous gas from the missing tiles can still be successfully blocked. Please helpJonesin this task.InputThe first line of the input is a positive integert ≤ 20, denoting the number of rooms.The descriptions for the t rooms follow one after the other.Room Description:The first line of the room description is a positive integern (n ≤ 10010), denoting the number of missing tile locations.This is followed by thenlines, one for each missing tile location.Each line contains two integersx y (0 ≤ x, y < 120), separated by a single space, representing the co-ordinates of the missing tile location.OutputThe output should consist oftlines, one for each room. Thekthline in the output should be an integermk, the minimum number of planks needed for thekthroom.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n1 0\r\n2 0\r\n3 0\r\n4\r\n1 1\r\n2 2\r\n3 3\r\n4 4Output:1\r\n4",
