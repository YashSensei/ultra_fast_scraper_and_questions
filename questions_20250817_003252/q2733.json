She has been studying divisibility, and has come with a new problem for you!Is there a positive number that is divisible by the firstNnatural numbers? If so, can you find the smallest one?Can you find the answer toQvalues ofN?You gladly accept this challenge, but with one condition: as the answers may be extremely large, you will show them modulo some numberMInputThe first line contains two integerQandM, which specify the number of questions to be answered and the modulo respectively. Then, will follow the descriptions of theQquestions.OutputFor each question you must print the answer to the challenge moduloMin a single line. In case there is no answer to the question, you must output -1ExampleInput:5 99090116122060Output:16027720921726823252Constraints1 ≤ Q ≤ 1031 ≤ N ≤ 3×1052 ≤ M ≤ 109",
