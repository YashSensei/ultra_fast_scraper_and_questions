  "text": "After trying to solve Problem Number 31 (Fast Multiplication) with some script languages that support arbitrary large integers and timing out, you wonder what would be the best language to do fast multiplication of integers.\r\nAnd naturally it comes to your mind: Of course it is brainf**k, because there are only very cheap operations in that language.InputTwo positive integers, ended with a line feed (ASCII 10) each.OutputThe product of the two integers, terminated by a line feed. You may assume that this number will be less than 10000.ExampleInput:\r\n1\r\n2\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n2",
