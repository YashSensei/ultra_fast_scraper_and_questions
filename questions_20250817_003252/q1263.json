  "text": "[Note:Symmetric Matrixis an easier version of this problem; you should try to solve it before this one.]You are given anNxNmatrixmijsuch thatmij== mjifori, j = 1, ..., N. We would like to compute the value ofNote that in the above expression we are going overKindicesi1, ..., iKthat run over the values1, ..., N, while summing over the product of all theK*(K-1)/2possible matrix elements that we can form with these indices.InputThe first line of the input contains two integersNandK(2 ≤ N ≤ 100and2 ≤ K ≤ 10), representing the number of rows and columns of the matrixmijand the number of sums in the formula above, respectively. The followingNlines containNintegers each, being thej-th number in thei-th line the value ofmij(-10  ≤ mij≤ 10andmij== mjifori, j = 1, ..., N).OutputPrint a single line with the result of the calculation. Because this number can be very big, output its remainder modulo division by1000000007(== 109+7).ExampleInput:4 54 5\r\n-4 -3 -4 2\r\n-3 -6 1 -8\r\n-4 1 -10 -6\r\n2 -8 -6 0Output:308822466",
