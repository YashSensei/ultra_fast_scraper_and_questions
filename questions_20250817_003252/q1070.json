  "text": "A spiritual baba in Banani claims that, given two strings he can check if one string is available in another string as sub-sequence and not only that, he can even tell the minimum sub-array in which that sub-sequence exists. Now your friend wants to know if that spiritual baba is fraud or not. So, he wants you to make an application for him.You are given two strings A & B. Now, find the minimum length sub-array of string ’A’ which contains the sub-sequence (string ‘B’). If such sub-sequence cannot be found, print -1.Subsequence:suppose a string “abcdef” is given. Here, ”abcdef”, “abf”, “def”, “bce”, “a” are some example of sub-sequence of this string. But strings like “fea” and “dc” are not.InputThe first line of the input contains an integerT (1 ≤ T ≤ 100)number of test cases. For each test case, two stringsA (1 ≤ N ≤ 2500)andB (1 ≤ M ≤ 80)are given, each containing lowercase letter of the English alphabet. Here N is length of stringAandMis length of stringB. Cases are separated by blank lines in input file.OutputOutput the case number and the expected answer for each test case.ExampleInput:2\r\naabbaaccanbbbncc\r\nabc\r\n\r\nobjectorientedprogramming\r\niiOutput:Case 1: 6\r\nCase 2: 15",
