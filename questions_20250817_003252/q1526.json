  "text": "Nobel the Littlefinger is a follower of the Lord of Light. So he likes7-segment displayso much because that works with LED lights.This is a diagram of a7-segment display.And this is how it works.There are 7 LED light in a 7-segment Display. These area, b, c, d, e, f, g.We can display any digit from 0 to 9 with these lights.For example, whena, b, g, c, dlights are on that means3is displayed.Whena, f, e, d, c, glights are on that means6is displayed.This way0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9can be displayed with a 7-segment Display.This is a very easy problem. You will be given a digit from 0 to 9 and you just have to tell the list of which lights should be on to display that digit.InputInput starts with an integerTdenoting the number of test cases. Each case contains an integerN.ConstraintsT≤ 10000 ≤N≤ 9OutputFor each case, print the case number and the list of the lights.You must print the list inlexicographical orderin other wordsdictionary order. That means ifaandbare a list,amust come beforeb. For digit '6' the list will beacdefg, notafedcg. For digit '9' the list will beabcdfg, notacbfdg.See the samples for further details.ExampleInput:3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3Output:Case 1: bc\r\nCase 2: abdeg\r\nCase 3: abcdg[ Original setter of this problem Pritom Kumar Paul, RUET ]",
