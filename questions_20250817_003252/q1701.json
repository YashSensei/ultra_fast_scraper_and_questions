  "text": "A and B are playing a very interesting variant of the ancient Indian game 'shatranj' (also known as chess) on a 'maidaan' (chessboard) n×n in size.They take turns to put game pieces called 'ghoda'(knight) so that no two 'ghodas' (knights) could threaten each other.A 'ghoda' located in square (a, b) can threaten squares (a + 1, b + 2), (a - 1, b + 2), (a + 1, b - 2), (a - 1, b - 2), (a + 2, b - 1), (a + 2, b + 1), (a - 2, b - 1), (a - 2, b + 1).The player who can't put a new 'ghoda' during his move loses. Find out which player wins considering that both players play optimally well and A starts.InputThe first line contains integer T (1≤T≤10^4) — the number of 'maidaans' (boards), for which you should determine the winning player. Next T lines contain T integers ni (1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^5) — the sizes of the 'maidaans' (chessboards).OutputFor each ni×ni board print on a single line \"0\" if A wins considering both players play optimally well. Otherwise, print \"1\".ExampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n1Output:1\r\n0",
