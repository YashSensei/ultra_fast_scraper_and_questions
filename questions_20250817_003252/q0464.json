  "text": "You are given an array ofNintegers. You tried to sum all the elements of the array, but you see thesummationdoes not reach the maximum.So you decide to divide the array into two arrays. You can choose any index( 1 ≤ i ≤ N )from arrayArand remove the value from theArarray and add it to another arrayA. Also, you can choose any index( 1 ≤ j ≤ N )and remove the value fromArand add it to another arrayBSuppose an arrayar = [ 1, 2, 3, 0, 5 ], so you can choose index1, 3, 5and remove it from arrayarand add it to arrayA. Soar = [ ., 2, ., 0, . ]andA=[ 1, 3, 5 ]. You can choose index2, 4and remove it from arrayarand add it to arrayB. Soar = [ ., ., ., ., . ]andB = [ 2, 0 ].You can do any operation until arrayarbecomes empty.Here is the main problem. You need to divide ar in such way thatSUM(A) - SUM(B)getsmaximized.HereSUM(X)means summation of the arrayx. Examplex = [ 1, 5, 8]soSUM(x) = 1 + 5 + 8 = 14.Now Print themaximumSUM(A) - SUM(B)you can get.BothAandBarray needs to contain at least1element from arrayar.InputFirst Line will containN( 2 ≤ N ≤ 106), the number of elements present in the array.Second line will contain arrayarofNelements.( -109≤ ari≤ 109).OutputPrint the maximum value you can get ofSUM(A) - SUM(B)after doing those operations.ExampleInput 01:5\r\n1 2 3 4 5Output 01:13Input 02:6\r\n-1 1 2 -2 3 -3Output 02:12",
