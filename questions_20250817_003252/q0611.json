Find the shortest sequence of moves that transfers a tower of n disks from the left peg A to the right peg C, if direct moves between A and C are disallowed. (Each move must be to or from the middle peg B.)ConstraintsInitially the left peg A in stacked by n disks in the order of decreasing size.Only one move can be done at a time and never moving a larger one onto a smaller.Number of moves will always be less than 264.1 ≤ n ≤ 35InputInput begins with an integer t, followed by t lines. Each line has the number of disks n.OutputFor each test case, output the minimum number of move required to transfer the n disks from peg A to peg C.ExampleInput:412510Output:2824259048",
