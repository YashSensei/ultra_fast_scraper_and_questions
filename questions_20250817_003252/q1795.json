The following operations are counted as 'steps':emptying a vessel,filling a vessel,pouring water from one vessel to the other, without spilling, until one of the vessels is either full or empty.InputAn integert, 1<=t<=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed bytsets of input data, each consisting of three positive integersa, b, c, not larger than 40000, given in separate lines.OutputFor each set of input data, output the minimum number of steps required to obtain c litres, or -1 if this is impossible.ExampleSample input:2\r\n5\r\n2\r\n3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4Sample output:2\r\n-1",
