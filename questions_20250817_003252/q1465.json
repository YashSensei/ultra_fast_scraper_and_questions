We would like to color them using four colors: white, black, red, and blue, in such a way that for every three consecutive points it is true that either:1. the colors of these three points are pairwise distinct, or2. the color of some point is white.InputAn integerT, denoting the number of testcases (T< 100000). In each line you are given one positive integer (n < 1000000000). There are 5 input sets.OutputFind the number of possible colorings of thenpoints. Since the answer can be very big, output only the answer modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:41231000Output:41643283570349Warning: large input/output data, be careful with certain languagesWarning: A naive algorithm will probably solve only the first input set.",
