This bee hive consists of many hexagonal honey combs   where the honey is stored in.But bee Maja has a problem. Willi told her   where she can meet him, but because Willi is a male drone and Maja is a female   worker they have different coordinate systems.Maja's Coordinate SystemWilli's Coordinate SystemMaja who often flies directly to a special honey comb has laid an advanced   two dimensional grid over the whole hive.Willi who is more lazy and often walks around just numbered the cells   clockwise starting from 1 in the middle of the hive.Help Maja to convert Willi's system to hers. Write a program which for a given   honey comb number gives the coordinates in Maja's system.InputThe input contains one or more integers which represent Willi's numbers.   Each number stands on its own in a separate line, directly followed by a   newline. The honey comb numbers are all less than 100 000.OutputYou should output the corresponding Maja coordinates to Willi's numbers,   each coordinate pair on a separate line.Sample Input12345Sample Output0 00 1-1 1-1 00 -1",
