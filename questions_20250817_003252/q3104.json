  "text": "Certain positive integers have their decimal representation consisting only of ones and zeros, and having at least one digit one, e.g. 101. If a positive integer does not have such a property, one can try to multiply it by some positive integer to find out whether the product has this property.InputNumberKof test cases (Kis approximately 1000);In each of the nextKlines there is one integern(1 ≤ n ≤ 20000)OutputFor each test case, your program should compute the smallest multiple of the numbernconsisting only of digits 1 and 0 (beginning with 1).ExampleInput:3\r\n17\r\n11011\r\n17Output:11101\r\n11011\r\n11101",
