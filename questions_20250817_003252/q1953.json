If his list matches the drawn list, he wins the big prize, a lifetime supply of large lemons.Lenny has a scheme that he thinks is likely to be lucky. He likes to choose his list so that each number in it is at least twice as large as the one before it. So, for example, ifn= 4 andm= 10, then the possible lucky lists Lenny could pick are:1 2 4 8\r\n    1 2 4 9\r\n    1 2 4 10\r\n    1 2 5 10Thus Lenny has 4 lists to choose from.Your job, givennandm, is to count how many lucky lists Lenny has to his disposal.InputThe first line of input is a single non-negative integer, which is the number of data sets to follow.
