  "text": "Fernando won a compass for his birthday, and now his favorite hobby is drawing stars: ﬁrst, he marksNpoints on a circumference, dividing it intoNequal arcs; then, he connects each point to thek-thnext point, until returning to the ﬁrst point.Depending on the value ofk, Fernando may or may not reach all points marked on the circumference; when that happens, the star is called complete. For example, whenN= 8, the possible stars are shown in the ﬁgure below. Stars (a) and (c) are complete, while stars (b) and (d) are not.Depending on the value ofN, it may be possible to draw many diﬀerent stars; Fernando asked you to write a program that, givenN, determines the number of complete stars he can draw.InputThe input contains several test cases. Each test case contains a single line, containing a single integerN(3 ≤N< 231), indicating the number of arcs in which the circumference was divided.OutputFor each test case, your program must print a single line containing a single integer, indicating the number of complete stars that can be drawn.ExampleInput:34518363602147483647Output:11236481073741823",
