  "text": "Everyone loves gambling in the Dicent City. Every Saturday the whole community \r\n\tmeets to attend a dice contest. They started a few years ago with a classic \r\n\tsix-sided die with 1 to 6 dots displayed on the sides and had a lot of fun.However they soon got bored and that's why more sophisticated dice are in use \r\n\tnowadays. They put a sticker on each side and write a positive integer on each \r\n\tsticker.The contest is run on a strip divided into squares in a chessboard-like manner. \r\n\tThe strip is 4 squares wide and infinite to the left and to the right (is \r\n\tanyone going to say it can't exist in the real world, huh?). The rows of the \r\n\tstrip are numbered from 1 to 4 from the bottom to the top and the columns are \r\n\tnumbered by consecutive integers from the left to the right. Each square is \r\n\tidentified by a pair (x,y) where x is a column number and y is a row number.The game begins with a die placed on a square chosen be a contest committee \r\n\twith one-dot side on the top and two-dots side facing the player. To move the \r\n\tdie the player must roll the die over an edge to an adjacent (either \r\n\thorizontally or vertically) square. The number displayed on the top of the die \r\n\tafter a roll is the cost of the move. The goal of the game is to roll the die \r\n\tfrom the starting square to the selected target square so that the sum of costs \r\n\tof all moves is minimal.TaskWrite a program that:reads the description of a die, a starting square and a target square,computes the minimal cost of rolling the die from the starting square to the \r\n\t\ttarget square,writes the result.Note: all teams participating in the contest received dice from the organisers.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case the first line of the input contains six integers l1, l2, \r\nl3, l4, l5, l6(1 < = li< = 50) separated by single spaces. Integer liis the number \r\nwritten on a side having originally i dots. The second line of the input \r\ncontains four integers x1, y1, x2, y2( -109< = x1, x2< = 109, 1 \r\n<= y1, y2< = 4) separated by single spaces. \r\nIntegers x1, y1are the column and the row number of the \r\nstarting square respectively. Integers x2, y2are the \r\ncolumn and the row number of the target square respectively.OutputFor each test case the first and the only line of the output should contain the \r\nminimal cost of rolling the die from the starting square to the target square.ExampleSample input:1\r\n1 2 8 3 1 4 \r\n-1 1 0 2Sample output:7",
