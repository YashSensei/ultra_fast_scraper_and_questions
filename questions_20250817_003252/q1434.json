  "text": "EnglishVietnameseAn  elephant  lives by  a  lake with N plants on  the  surface. The  lake can be modeled by  a  coordinate plane, with plants at points with integer coordinates. Every morning  after waking  up,  the  elephant  performs  his morning  exercise,  happily  jumping  from plant  to plant. For  reasons best  left undiscussed,  the elephant can always jump only  to another plant with both coordinates larger than the coordinates of the plant it is currently on. In other words, from plant (x1, y1) the elephant can jump to plant (x2, y2) only if x2 > x1 and y2 > y1. The elephant can start his exercise at any plant on the lake.  Write a program that, given the coordinates of all plants, calculates the length of the longest sequence of  plants  the  elephant  can  visit.  Additionally,  calculate  the  number  of  different  such  longest sequences. Because this second number can be large, calculate it modulo 1 000 000 007.InputThe first line contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 300 000), the number of plants. Each of the following N  lines contains the coordinates of one plant, two  integers between 0 and 109. No two plants will have the same pair of coordinates.OutputOn the first line output the length of the longest sequence of plants the elephant can jump on. On the second line output the number of such sequences of maximum length, modulo 1 000 000  007.Sampleinput118 67 45 45 15 66 23 24 34 53 52 4output43input61 32 23 15 34 43 5output27",
