  "text": "Cryptographic analysis makes extensive use of the frequency with which\r\nletters and letter sequences occur in a language. If an encrypted\r\ntext is known to be in English, for example, a great deal can be\r\nlearned from the fact that the letters E, L, N, R, S, and T are the\r\nmost common ones used in written English. Even more can be learned if\r\ncommon letter pairs, triplets, etc. are known.For this problem you are to write a program which accepts as input a\r\ntext file of unspecified length and performs letter sequence analysis\r\non the text. The program will report the five most frequent letter\r\nsequences for each set of sequences from one to five letters. That is\r\nit will report the individual characters which occur with the five\r\nhighest frequencies, the pairs of characters which occur with the five\r\nhighest frequencies, and so on up to the letter sequences of five\r\ncharacters which occur with the five highest frequencies.The program should consider contiguous sequences of alphabetic\r\ncharacters only, and case should be ignored (e.g. an 'a' is the same\r\nas an 'A'). A report should be produced using the format shown in the\r\nexample at the end of this problem description. For each sequence\r\nlength from one to five, the report should list the sequences in\r\ndescending order of frequency. If there are several sequences with\r\nthe same frequency then all sequences should be listed in alphabetical\r\norder as shown (list all sequences in upper case). Finally, if there\r\nare less than five distinct frequencies for a particular sequence\r\nlength, simply report as many distinct frequency lists as possible.When a text file containing simply the line ''Peter Piper Picks\r\nPickles!'' is used as input, the output should appear as shown here:Analysis for Letter Sequences of Length 1\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 5, Sequence(s) = (P)\r\nFrequency = 4, Sequence(s) = (E)\r\nFrequency = 3, Sequence(s) = (I)\r\nFrequency = 2, Sequence(s) = (C,K,R,S)\r\nFrequency = 1, Sequence(s) = (L,T)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 2\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 3, Sequence(s) = (PI)\r\nFrequency = 2, Sequence(s) = (CK,ER,IC,PE)\r\nFrequency = 1, Sequence(s) = (ES,ET,IP,KL,KS,LE,TE)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 3\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 2, Sequence(s) = (ICK,PIC)\r\nFrequency = 1, Sequence(s) = (CKL,CKS,ETE,IPE,KLE,LES,PER,PET,PIP,TER)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 4\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 2, Sequence(s) = (PICK)\r\nFrequency = 1, Sequence(s) = (CKLE,ETER,ICKL,ICKS,IPER,KLES,PETE,PIPE)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 5\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 1, Sequence(s) = (CKLES,ICKLE,PETER,PICKL,PICKS,PIPER)When the first three paragraphs of this problem description are used\r\nas input, the output should appear as shown here:Analysis for Letter Sequences of Length 1\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 201, Sequence(s) = (E)\r\nFrequency = 112, Sequence(s) = (T)\r\nFrequency = 96, Sequence(s) = (S)\r\nFrequency = 90, Sequence(s) = (R)\r\nFrequency = 84, Sequence(s) = (N)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 2\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 37, Sequence(s) = (TH)\r\nFrequency = 33, Sequence(s) = (EN)\r\nFrequency = 27, Sequence(s) = (HE)\r\nFrequency = 24, Sequence(s) = (RE)\r\nFrequency = 23, Sequence(s) = (NC)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 3\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 24, Sequence(s) = (THE)\r\nFrequency = 21, Sequence(s) = (ENC,EQU,QUE,UEN)\r\nFrequency = 12, Sequence(s) = (NCE,SEQ,TER)\r\nFrequency = 9, Sequence(s) = (CES,FRE,IVE,LET,REQ,TTE)\r\nFrequency = 8, Sequence(s) = (ETT,FIV)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 4\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 21, Sequence(s) = (EQUE,QUEN)\r\nFrequency = 20, Sequence(s) = (UENC)\r\nFrequency = 12, Sequence(s) = (ENCE,SEQU)\r\nFrequency = 9, Sequence(s) = (FREQ,NCES,REQU)\r\nFrequency = 8, Sequence(s) = (ETTE,FIVE,LETT,TTER)\r\n\r\nAnalysis for Letter Sequences of Length 5\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nFrequency = 21, Sequence(s) = (EQUEN)\r\nFrequency = 20, Sequence(s) = (QUENC)\r\nFrequency = 12, Sequence(s) = (SEQUE,UENCE)\r\nFrequency = 9, Sequence(s) = (ENCES,FREQU,REQUE)\r\nFrequency = 8, Sequence(s) = (ETTER,LETTE)",
