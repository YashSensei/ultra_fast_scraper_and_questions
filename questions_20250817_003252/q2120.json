  "text": "You are given a sequence ofnnumbersa0...an−1. A cyclic shift bykpositions (0 ≤k≤n−1) results in the following sequence:ak,ak+1...an−1,a0,a1...ak−1. How many of thencyclic shifts satisfy the condition that the sum of the firstinumbers is greater than or equal to zero for alliwith 1 ≤i≤n?InputEach test case consists of two lines. The first contains the numbern(1 ≤n≤ 106), the number of integers in the sequence. The second containsnintegersa0...an−1(−1000 ≤ai≤ 1000) representing the sequence of numbers. The input will finish with a line containing 0.OutputFor each test case, print one line with the number of cyclic shifts of the given sequence which satisfy the condition stated above.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 2 1\r\n3\r\n-1 1 1\r\n1\r\n-1\r\n0Output:3\r\n2\r\n0Problem setter: Adrian Kuegel",
