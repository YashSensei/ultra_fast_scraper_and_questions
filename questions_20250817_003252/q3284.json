  "text": "Bruce Force is standing in the forest.  He wonders what is the tree trunk the farthest\r\naway which is not blocked from his view by other tree trunks.Bruce has made a map of the trees in the forest.\r\nThe map shows his current position as the origin of a cartesian coordinate system.\r\nTreeiis shown on the map as a circle with the center (xi, yi) and radiusri.\r\nYou may assume that a tree trunk is visible if and only if there exists a line segment on\r\nthe map from the origin (0,0) to a point on the border of the circle representing the tree trunk, where the line segment\r\ndoes not intersect or touch another circle.InputThe input contains several test cases.\r\nThe first line of each test case contains one numbern(1 ≤ n ≤ 1000),\r\nwherenspecifies how many trees are on the map.\r\nThe followingnlines contain 3 integersxi,yi,rieach,\r\n(-10000 ≤ xi, yi≤ 10000,1 ≤ ri≤ 1000)\r\nwhere (xi,yi) is the center of the circle representing tree trunki,\r\nandriis the radius of the circle.\r\nYou may assume that no two circles in the input intersect, i.e., for\r\nany two circles, the distance between their centers is more than the sum of their radii.\r\nMoreover, you may assume that no circle contains the origin.The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.OutputFor each test case, print one line with the maximum Euclidean distance from\r\nthe origin to a visible tree. The distance to a tree should be measured\r\nusing the point of the tree closest to the origin, no matter if this point is\r\nin fact visible or not.Round the answer to 3 digits after the decimal point.ExampleInput:3\r\n10 10 11\r\n1 1 1\r\n-20 -10 20\r\n5\r\n1 2 2\r\n-2 1 1\r\n2 -1 1\r\n-1 -2 2\r\n10000 -10000 1000\r\n0Output:3.142\r\n1.236",
