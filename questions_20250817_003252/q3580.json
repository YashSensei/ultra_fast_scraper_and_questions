  "text": "Consider a board with fields numbered from 0 ton. On each fieldi∈ {1...n} there is an integer (possibly negative) numberai∈ Z. A player is given a pawn on field number 0. Player can move the pawn back and front on distance not exceedingk. A pawn can visit all the fields many 0, andnmany times, but it can stop moving definitively only at positionn(player decides on when to stop). Whenever a pawn visits fieldi, the field is cleared and the numberaiis removed (if the field wasn’t clear before the move). A player wants to maximize the sum of numbers on non-cleared fields.Write a program that reads on the standard input the description of a game, and writes on standard output the value of an optimal strategy.InputOn the first line of input you are given the numbern(1 ≤n≤ 1000). On the second line of input you are given the parameterk(1 ≤k≤n). In the nextn− 1 lines of the input you are given single integer numbers, where on linei+ 2 you are given the numberai. There are no values given for fields 0 andn, because these positions will be always clear at the end of the game.OutputA single integer giving the required answer on a separate line for each test case.ExampleInput:5\r\n5\r\n15\r\n5\r\n8\r\n15Output:43Input:5\r\n2\r\n15\r\n5\r\n8\r\n15Output:30",
