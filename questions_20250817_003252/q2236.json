  "text": "Angel Luis is now getting math class. His teacher is teaching to him the XOR operation:0 XOR 0 = 00 XOR 1 = 11 XOR 0 = 11 XOR 1 = 0When a number has more than one bit, the operation is applied to all bits. The teacher write two numbers x, y (0 <= x, y <= N) and make the XOR operation between x and y, Angel Luis would like to know how many pairs x, y such x XOR y = 2zwhere z >= 0.See that for N = 3:0 XOR 1 = 200 XOR 2 = 213 XOR 1 = 212 XOR 3 = 20So there are 4 pairs.Given N you should return the number of pairs modulo 1000000007.InputFirst line contains number t - the number of cases. Following t lines will each have a number N.t <= 100N <= 1000000000000000 (1015).OutputFor each case the number of pairs modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3Output:1\r\n2\r\n4",
