  "text": "Arbitrage is the use of discrepancies in currency exchange rates to transform one unit of a currency into more than one unit of the same currency. For example, suppose that 1 US Dollar buys 0.5 British pounds, 1 British pound buys 10.0 French francs, and 1 French franc buys 0.21 US dollars. Then, by converting currencies, a clever trader can start with 1 US dollar and buy 0.5 * 10.0 * 0.21 = 1.05 US dollars, making a profit of 5 percent.Your job is to write a program that takes a list of currency exchange rates as input and then determines whether arbitrage is possible or not.InputThe input file will contain one or more test cases.  On the first line of each test case there is an integern(1<=n<=30),  representing the number of different currencies. The nextnlines each contain the name of one currency. Within a name no spaces will appear. The next line contains one integerm, representing the length of the table to follow. The lastmlines each contain the nameciof a source currency, a real numberrijwhich represents the exchange rate fromcitocjand a namecjof  the destination currency. Note thatciandcjmay be the same currency. Exchanges which do not appear in the table are impossible.Test cases are separated from each other by a blank line. Input is terminated by a value of zero (0) forn.OutputFor each test case, print one line telling whether arbitrage is possible or not in the format \"Casecase: Yes\", respectively \"Casecase: No\".ExampleInput:3\r\nUSDollar\r\nBritishPound\r\nFrenchFranc\r\n\r\n3\r\nUSDollar 0.5 BritishPound\r\nBritishPound 10.0 FrenchFranc\r\nFrenchFranc 0.21 USDollar\r\n\r\n3\r\nUSDollar\r\nBritishPound\r\nFrenchFranc\r\n\r\n6\r\nUSDollar 0.5 BritishPound\r\nUSDollar 4.9 FrenchFranc\r\nBritishPound 10.0 FrenchFranc\r\nBritishPound 1.99 USDollar\r\nFrenchFranc 0.09 BritishPound\r\nFrenchFranc 0.19 USDollar\r\n\r\n0Output:Case 1: Yes\r\nCase 2: No",
