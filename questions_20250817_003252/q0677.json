  "text": "A new planet full of rivers was discovered and is being prepared for colonization. We want to connect every piece of land by bridges, the cost of building a bridge is its width.InputThe first number in the input file is T < 200, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line with a integer, N ≤ 500, the number of rivers. N lines are followed with 5 integers each, Di1, Fi1, Di2, Fi2 and Wi ≤ 1000000, the coordinates of the extremities and the width of the i-th river. Every D is between -90 and 90, and every F is between 0 and 359, they are measured in degrees and correspond to the spherical coordinates (latitude and longitude respectively).The two extremities of a river can be seen from above in a distance less than infinite, a course of a river is always the smallest possible and two rivers intersect in at most 1 point.OutputFor each test case print a single line with \"Case #X: C\" where X is the number of the test case (starting from 1) and C is the minimum cost to build the bridges so the islands and continents are connected directly or indirectly to each other.ExampleInput:340 0 90 0 490 0 0 179 20 0 -90 0 1-90 0 0 179 160 0 10 90 30 0 -20 90 30 179 10 90 50 179 -20 90 10 0 0 179 10-20 90 20 90 110 2 0 3 1Output:Case #1: 1Case #2: 6Case #3: 0",
