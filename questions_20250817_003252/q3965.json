In how many ways she can break it into triangles, by cutting it with (n-3) non-adjacent diagonals and the diagonals do not intersect.InputFirst line of the input will be an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000) which is the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000) which is the size of the polygon.OutputFor each test case output the no of ways %100007.ExampleInput:235Output:15",
