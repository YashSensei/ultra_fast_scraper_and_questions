  "text": "Phone ListGiven a list of phone numbers, determine if it is consistent in the\r\nsense that no number is the prefix of another. Let’s say the phone\r\ncatalogue listed these numbers:Emergency 911Alice 97 625 999Bob 91 12 54 26In this case, it’s not possible to call Bob, because the central would\r\ndirect your call to the emergency line as soon as you had dialled the\r\nfirst three digits of Bob’s phone number. So this list would not be\r\nconsistent.InputThe first line of input gives a single integer, 1 ≤t≤ 40, the number of test cases. Each test case starts withn, the number of phone numbers, on a separate line, 1 ≤n≤ 10000.\r\nThen followsnlines with one unique phone number on each line. A phone number is a sequence of at most ten digits.OutputFor each test case, output “YES” if the list is consistent, or “NO” otherwise.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n911\r\n97625999\r\n91125426\r\n5\r\n113\r\n12340\r\n123440\r\n12345\r\n98346Output:NO\r\nYES",
