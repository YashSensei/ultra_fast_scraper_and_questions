  "text": "For the fall semester 2010, EPFL proudly welcomed 2300 new students to the campus. Handling their registrations to the different sections and levels requires an administrative masterstroke. Nowadays this process is highly automated and worked impeccably up to this year...The software that handles the registrations wasn’t lead out for such a huge number of new students and the secretaries were close to a heart attack when they received the registration printouts. Instead of receiving one sheet per class (defined by the orientation of studies and the level, e.g. Architecture, Bachelor 1) containing the list of all the students registered to that class, the printouts contained sentences in 5 different formats:!STUDENT_ID1studiesSECTION!STUDENT_ID1enters semesterSEMESTER!STUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2chose the same studies!STUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2are in same semester!STUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2are in same classSTUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2are the 6-digit sciper numbers,SEMESTERis an integer number in the range from 1 to 10 andSECTIONis a one-worded string.The secretaries were very puzzled and couldn’t figure out how to recreate the expected lists from these printouts. But luckily they remembered PolyProg. The desperate secretaries provide you with the printouts and you are to answer their impatient questions to your best.? What doesSTUDENT_ID1study? Which semester willSTUDENT_ID1enter? AreSTUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2classmatesTwo students are considered to be classmates if and only if they study the same subject and enter the same semester. Answering to your best means that your answer must be as complete as possible, you must never give an erroneous answer, but you can just admit that the input was insufficient to answer a question at the point in time it was asked.Your answers shall respect the following priority:QuestionAnswer? What doesSTUDENT_ID1studySTUDENT_ID1studiesSECTIONSorry, I have no clue yet? Which semester willSTUDENT_ID1enterSTUDENT_ID1enters semesterSEMESTERSorry, I have no clue yet? AreSTUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2classmatesYes,STUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2are classmatesNo, this is not possiblePossible, given thatSTUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2study the same subjectPossible, given thatSTUDENT_ID1andSTUDENT_ID2are in the same semesterSorry, I have no clue yetInputThe input consists of a single test-case with no more than 1’000 printout sentences and no more than 500 questions. They may be mixed and you are to go through them in sequential order, which means that in order to answer a question, you must not rely on any information further down the list. You may safely assume that the sentences are not contradictory! Input terminates on a line containing the single word END.OutputOutput your answers, one per line and terminate with a newline. Be aware of typos :)SampleInput:! 166554 and 175129 chose the same studies\r\n! 175129 and 170113 are in same semester\r\n! 166554 studies electronics\r\n! 169983 and 170113 chose the same studies\r\n?
