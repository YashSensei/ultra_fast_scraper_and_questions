  "text": "In the 3D Cartesian coordinate system, there are n cubes. These cubes are all axis-parallel. What's the volume of the union of these cubes?InputThere is a single integer m in the very first line of the input, the number of test cases. m blocks follow.For each test, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of cubes. n lines follow, each contains four integers x, y, z, r (-1000 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ r ≤ 200), separated by spaces.\r\nx, y, z are the X, Y, Z coordinates of the center of the  cube, and r is the distance between the center and any surface of the cube.Outputm lines, each contains a single integer - the answer.ExampleSample Input:1\r\n3\r\n0 0 0 3\r\n1 -1 0 1\r\n19 3 5 6Sample Output:1944",
