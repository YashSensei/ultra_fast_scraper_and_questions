For each building in the city Dukker calculate the number of buildings having less height in left of that building(sayHmini) and number of buildings having greater height in right of that building(sayHmaxi). He putHmini+ Hmaxinumber of flags in container ofithbuilding.He took all containers from the buildings and shuffles them. Now he wants to distribute flags among buildings of city such that each building should get same number of flag and a building will get all the flags from single container.Score of city is the maximum number of flags that a building can have.InputInput consist ofTnumber of test cases. Each case contains two lines. First line containsNdenoting number of buildings in a city. Second line will containNintegersHidenoting height of each building.ConstraintsT≤ 100 <N≤ 1050 ≤Hi≤ 109OutputOutput should containTline denoting score of that city.ExampleInput:3\r\n5\r\n1 2 3 4 5\r\n5\r\n4 2 5 3 1\r\n3\r\n3 3 3Output:4\r\n1\r\n0",
