  "text": "The government ofSpoj_landhas selected a number of locations in the city for road construction and numbered those locations as 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 500.Now, they want to construct roads between various pairs of location (sayAandB) and have fixed the cost for travelling between those pair of locations from either end asW unit.Now, Rohit being a curious boy wants to find the minimum cost for travelling from locationU(source) toQnumber of other locations (destination).InputFirst line containsN,the number of roads that government constructed.Next N line contains three integersA,B, andW.A and B represent the locations between which the road was constructed and W is the fixed cost for travelling from A to B or from B to A.Next line contains an integerUfrom where Rohit wants to travel to other locations.Next line containQ, the number of queries (finding cost) that he wants to perform.NextQlines contain an integerV(destination) for which minimum cost is to be foundfrom U.OutputPrint the required answer in each line.If he can't travel from location U to V by any means then, print 'NO PATH' without quotes.ExampleInput:7\r\n0 1 4\r\n0 3 8\r\n1 4 1\r\n1 2 2\r\n4 2 3\r\n2 5 3\r\n3 4 2\r\n0\r\n4\r\n1\r\n4\r\n5\r\n7Output:4\r\n5\r\n9\r\nNO PATHConstraints1 <= N <= 5000 <= A, B <= 5001 <= W <= 1000 <= U, V <= 5001 <= Q <= 500ExplanationQuery #1: 0 → 1: cost = 4Query #2: 0 → 4: 0 → 1 → 4, cost = 4 + 1 = 5Query #3: 0 → 5: 0 → 1 → 2 → 5, cost = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9Query #4: 0 → 7: no path exist between 0 and 7",
