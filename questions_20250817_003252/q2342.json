  "text": "Hi Guys,Yesterday my nephew visited me and we played with lego.We took a board of 5 × 5 and created different mazes. We decided that we need perfect maze - One that has minimum lego pieces, but there should be exactly one path between each pair of cells without lego.We quickly found out that we needed just 6 pieces and built all 22 configurations using them.Some of them:But then he took his board of 13 x 13 and said - let's build perfect maze here!Now we have no idea how many pieces we need and how many configurations we should build. Please help!InputNone.OutputTwo numbers - number of single lego pieces we need to build perfect maze on 13 × 13 board and number of configurations of them.Thanks!",
