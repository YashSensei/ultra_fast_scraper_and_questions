  "text": "There's a Cartesian lattice with 0 ≤ x, y ≤ n. Given one point (x1, y1 > 0) in this lattice rotating clockwise as little as possible around the origin find the next point (x2, y2). The given and searched points mustn't have another point between the origin (0, 0) and this point itself.x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers.InputIn the first line the number T (T < 10000) of test cases. Then T lines follow each with the space-separated n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000), x1 and y1.OutputFor each test case the space-separated x2 and y2.ExampleInput:31 1 15 3 2100 97 98Output:1 05 398 99",
