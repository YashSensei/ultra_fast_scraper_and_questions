One direction leads to the dragon.\r\nIf the hero, in full armour, went into the dragon's bedroom,\r\nhe would surely wake him up and become breakfast in bed.\r\nSo, the hero will definitely choose the other option.\r\nThe hero always reads this signpost into a single line,\r\nby itself. Oh, here comes the first crossroads, \r\nthought the hero to himself.\r\nLeft to dragon.
