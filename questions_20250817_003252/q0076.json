  "text": "You are given a sequence A[1], A[2] ... A[N] . ( |A[i]| ≤  15007 , 1 ≤ N ≤ 50000 ). A query is defined as follows:Query(x, y) = Max { a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[j] ; x ≤ i ≤ j ≤ y }.Given M queries, your program must output the results of these queries.InputThe first line of the input file contains the integer N.In the second line, N numbers follow.The third line contains the integer M.M lines follow, where line i contains 2 numbers xi and yi.OutputYour program should output the results of the M queries, one query per line.ExampleInput:3 \r\n-1 2 3\r\n1\r\n1 2Output:2",
