  "text": "For a given numberNyou haveKcopies of each number from 1 to N. Therefore, you have a total ofN*Knumbers. You need to formMsetss1, s2, s3, .... smwhere a set should contain unique numbers (set may be empty).Now, let D be the sum of size of all M sets. (Where the size of a set is number of elements in it)LetG(i)= number of ways to form M sets such that D is equal to i.FindG(0) + G(1) + ... G(N*K)modulo 10^9 + 7.Note: Ordering of sets matters as the sets are numbered.For exampleN = 2, M = 2, K = 2So, the numbers present initially are (1, 1, 2, 2)G(0) = 1,{ }, { }G(1) = 4:{1}, { }{2}, { }{ }, {1}{ }, {2}G(2) = 6:{1}, {2}{2}, {1}{1}, {1}{2}, {2}{1, 2}, { }{ }, {1, 2}G(3) = 4:{1, 2}, {1}{1, 2}, {2}{1}, {1, 2}{2}, {1, 2}G(4) = 1:{1, 2}, {1, 2}Where { } represents empty set. So answer = G(0) + G(1) + G(2) + G(3) + G(4) = 16InputFirst line of input consists of integer t denoting number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contain 3 integers N, M, K where N >= M >= KOutputOutput consists of t lines. Each line contains the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.Constraints1 <= t <= 1001 <= M <= N <= 1000000 <= K <= MExampleInput:3\r\n2 2 2\r\n4 3 1\r\n3 1 1Output:16\r\n256\r\n8",
