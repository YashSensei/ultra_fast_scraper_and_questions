(You can assume each number is consider as a soldier).We define the strength of numberias the number of set bits (bits equal to 1) in binary representation of numberi.If the greatest common divisor of numbersaandbisgcd(a,b),Rastas would like to calculate the functionSwhich is equal to:As the friend of Rastas, it's your duty to calculateSmodulo 109+ 7.InputThe first line of the input contains the number of test cases,T. Each of the nextTlines contains an integern, as mentioned in the question.OutputFor each value ofngiven, find the value of the functionS.ConstraintsSum ofnover all test cases doesn't exceed2500.ExampleInput:3 \r\n1 \r\n2 \r\n5Output:0 \r\n3\r\n680",
