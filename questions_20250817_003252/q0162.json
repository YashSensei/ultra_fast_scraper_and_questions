  "text": "The cows are so modest they want Farmer John to install covers around the circular corral where they occasionally gather. The corral has circumference C (1 ≤ C ≤ 1,000,000,000), and FJ can choose from a set of M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100,000) covers that have fixed starting points and sizes. At least one set of covers can surround the entire corral.Cover i can be installed at integer location xi(distance from starting point around corral) (0 ≤ xi< C) and has integer length li(1 ≤ li≤ C).FJ wants to minimize the number of segments he must install. What is the minimum number of segments required to cover the entire circumference of the corral?Consider a corral of circumference 5, shown below as a pair of connected line segments where both '0's are the same point on the corral (as are both 1's, 2's, and 3's).Three potential covering segments are available for installation:Start   Length\r\n      i      xili1      0       1\r\n      2      1       2\r\n      3      3       3\r\n\r\n        0   1   2   3   4   0   1   2   3  ...\r\ncorral: +---+---+---+---+--:+---+---+---+- ...\r\n        1111                1111\r\n            22222222            22222222\r\n                    333333333333\r\n            |..................|As shown, installing segments 2 and 3 cover an extent of (at least) five units around the circumference. FJ has no trouble with the overlap, so don't worry about that.Input:Line 1: Two space-separated integers: C and M.Lines 2..M+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers: xiand liOutput:Line 1: A single integer that is the minimum number of segments required to cover all segments of the circumference of the corral.SampleInput5 3\r\n0 1\r\n1 2\r\n3 3Output2",
