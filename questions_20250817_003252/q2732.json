  "text": "Ciempierre is a funnyn-pede, and arthropod with exactlyNlegs. He likes clothing, and today he boughtNdifferent shoes andNdifferent socks. To get dressed, he has to put exactly one sock and one shoe on every leg.He is a bit eccentric, and he wants to get dressed every morning in adifferent way. He defines a way of getting dressed as the order he puts his clothes on. In one step, he can choose one leg and one sockorone shoe. Two ways of getting dressed are different if there is at least one step where he chooses a different leg or, in case of using the same leg, a different sock or shoe.For example, if Ciempierre has two legs he will buy two different socks and two different shoes. One way of getting dressed is:Put sock 1 on leg 1Put sock 2 on leg 2Put shoe 1 on leg 1Put shoe 2 on leg 2Notice that two ways are not necessarily equal if they make Ciempierre look the same. For example, if we swap the first and second steps on the example explained above, it would have been a different way of getting dressed, but his look would had been the same.Not all the ways of getting dressed are valid, though. Ciempierre can't put a shoe on a legbeforeputting a sock on that leg first.Given the number of legs Ciempierre has, can you calculate the number of different ways he can get dressed?InputThe first and only line of the input will have an integerN, being the number of legs Ciempierre has, and for instance the number of different socks and different shoes he bought.OutputPrint the number of different ways he can get dressed. As this number can be really big, you must print it modulo 109+ 7ExampleInput:2Output:24Input:3Output:3240Input:1Output:1Input:10Output:540458589Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 105",
