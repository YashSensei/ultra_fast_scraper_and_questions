  "text": "The loneris a one-dimensional board game for a single player. The board \r\n\tis composed of squares arranged in a single line, some of which initially have \r\n\tpawns on them. The player makes a move by jumping with a pawn over a pawn on an \r\n\tadjacent field, to an empty square two fields to the right or left of its \r\n\tinitial position. The pawn that was jumped over is removed directly after the \r\n\tmove, as illustrated below.The game is considered won if exactly one pawn remains on the gaming board, and is lost if the player cannot make a move.Given the initial state of the gaming board, your task is to determine whether \r\n\tit is possible for the player to win the game.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.Each test cases begins with the positive integer n â‰¤ 32000, denoting the \r\n\tsize of the gaming board. The second and last line of the test case description \r\n\tcontains a sequence of n characters 0 or 1, without any white spaces. The i-th \r\n\tsquare of the board is occupied by a pawn at the start of the game iff the i-th \r\n\tcharacter of this sequence is 1.OutputFor each test case output the wordyesif it is possible for the \r\n\tplayer to win the game for the presented starting configuration, or the wordnoin the opposite case.ExampleSample input:2\r\n7\r\n0110011\r\n6\r\n111001Sample output:yes\r\nno",
