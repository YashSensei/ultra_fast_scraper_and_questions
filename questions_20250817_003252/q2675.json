  "text": "A cone with radius of base 'r' and height 'h', is stretched to the left and right by length 'a' and 'b' respectively such that height of the stretched cones equal the height of the original cone and apexes of all the three cones are colinear.Write a program to calculate the volume of the union of the two stretched cones (colored blue in image).InputThe first line of input is the number of test cases T. (1 ≤ T ≤ 100)For each test case, there is a single line containing 4 integers 'r', 'h', 'a' and 'b' respectively. (0 < r, h, a, b ≤ 10)OutputOutput a single line for each test case, containing the volume with 1 decimal place only. Answer should be correct to 1 decimal place without rounding off.ExampleInput:2\r\n1 1 1 1\r\n10 10 10 10Output:1.4\r\n1491.6",
