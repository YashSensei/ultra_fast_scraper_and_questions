  "text": "There is a regular n-gon. We mark some points on its sides: a1 points on the first side, a2 on the second ... an on the last. Marked points do not coincide with the vertices n-gon. The question is, how many different convex nondegenerate (n-1)-gons you can build, using marked points as vertices?InputThe first line of input contains the number t - the number of tests. Next comes the description of t tests. Each test consists of two lines. The first line of the test contains an integer n - number of vertices of original n-gon. Second line of the test lists n integers a1, a2 ... an - number of points marked on each side.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 204 ≤ n ≤ 10001 ≤ ai ≤ 100OutputFor each test, print out the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n4\r\n2 2 2 2\r\n5\r\n2 2 2 2 2\r\n5\r\n10 20 30 40 50Output:56\r\n210\r\n16207125",
