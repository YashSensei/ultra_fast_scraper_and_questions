  "text": "We call a sequence of n non-negative integersA, awesome if there exists some positive integersx > 1such that each elementAiin A (where0 ≤ i < n) is evenly divisible byx. Recall thataevenly dividesbif there exists some integercsuch thatb = a * c.Given an awesome sequence,Aand a positive integerk, find and print the maximum integerL, which satisfies the following conditions:0 ≤ L ≤ KA ∪ {L} is also awesome. (∪is the union operator.)InputThe first line contains the integertdenoting the number of test cases. The next line contains two space-separated positive integers,n(length of the sequenceA) andk(the upper bound of answerL).The third line containsnspace separated positive integers describing the elements ofA.OutputFor each test case, Print the value ofLin a single line (whereLis the maximum integer ≤ k and A ∪ {L} is also awesome). As 0 is evenly divisible by anyx > 1, there will always be an answer.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 121 ≤ n ≤ 1000001 ≤ k ≤ 10000000001 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000ExampleInput:2\r\n3 5\r\n2 6 4\r\n1 5\r\n7Output:4\r\n0",
