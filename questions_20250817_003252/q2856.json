  "text": "Ada the Ladybug has decided to do some \"Spring Cleaning\". As you might know, she keeps a TODO list. She is very sparing so she keeps all her activities as one string. You might get very confused while reading the string but she has a system - every activity has length exactlyKcharacters. Sadly, as new activities were added to the list many duplicities appeared. Now it is time to find out how manyuniqueactivities are in her TODO list.InputFirst line containsT, number of test-cases.Each test-case begins withN, K,1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤     105, length of string and length of activities respectively.Next line consists of string of lengthN, consisting of lowercase letters.The sum of lengths of strings among all test-cases won't exceed3*105OutputFor each test-case, print the number of unique substrings of lengthKExample Input5\r\n3 2\r\naaa\r\n5 1\r\nabcba\r\n4 2\r\nabac\r\n10 2\r\nabbaaaabba\r\n7 3\r\ndogodogExample Output1\r\n3\r\n3\r\n4\r\n4",
