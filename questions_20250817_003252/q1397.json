The ﬁrst line of each test case  contains an integer n, indicating the number of points on the plane. Each of  the following n lines contains two integer xi and yi, indicating the ith points.  The last line of the input is an integer −1, indicating the end of input,  which should not be processed. You may assume that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and  −104≤ xi, yi ≤ 104for all i = 1 ... n.Sample Input\n3\n3 4\n2 6\n2 7\n5\n2 6\n3 9\n2 0\n8 0\n6 5\n-1OutputFor each test case, print a line containing the maximum area, which contains  two digits after the decimal point. You may assume that there is always an answer which is greater than zero.Sample output\n0.50\n27.00",
