  "text": "The King of DragonStone is known for his dragons and magic. It can be very hard and dangerous to tame a dragon. So, in order to control his dragons The King speaks random but powerful words. The strength of his words is determined by a strange rule. Rule : Strength of a word is sum of cube of length of palindromic substrings in the word. To recall the definition of palindrome, palindrome is a word which reads same when read forward and backward. For example, word \"abaa\" has 6 palindromic substrings. \"aba\", \"aa\", \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"a\" with sizes 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 respectively. Their cubes are 27, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1. Hence total strength is 39. Given a King's word, find its strength.InputFirst line of input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Followed by T lines, each line containing a word (say S). (only lowercase letters are allowed).Constraints:1 ≤ length of word ≤ 10001 ≤ T ≤ 100OutputFor every word (S), output a single line containing the strength of the word.ExampleInput:2\r\nabaa\r\ndbdOutput:39\r\n30Note: There is no space between lines",
