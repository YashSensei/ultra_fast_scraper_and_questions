  "text": "You are given a sequence A of n integer numbers (1 ≤ Ai≤ n). A subsequence of A has the form Au, Au+1... Av(1 ≤ u ≤ v ≤ n). We are interested in subsequences that are permutations of 1, 2 ... k (k is the length of the subsequence).Your task is to find the longest subsequence of this type.InputLine 1: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)Line 2: n numbers A1, A2... An(1 ≤ Ai≤ n)OutputA single integer that is the length of the longest permutationExampleInput:5\r\n4 1 3 1 2Output:3",
