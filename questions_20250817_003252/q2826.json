  "text": "Perhaps the first thing one notices when the Fibonacci sequence is reduced modpis that\r\nit seems periodic.For example :\r\nF (mod 2) =01 10 1 1 0 1 ... \r\nF (mod 3) =01 1 202 2 10 1 1 2 ... \r\nF (mod 5) =01 1 2 303 3 1 404 4 3 202 2 4 10 1 1 2 3 ...We defineZ(p) the number of zeros in fundamental period of Fibonacci numbers modp(if it is periodic).\r\nWe just saw thatZ(2) = 1,Z(3) = 2, andZ(5) = 4.InputThe first line containsT, the number of test cases.\r\nEach of the nextTlines contains a prime numberp.OutputFor each test case, printZ(p), or \"Not periodic.\" without quotes if need.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n5Output:1\r\n2\r\n4Constraints1 < T < 10^5\r\n1 < p < 10^18, a prime numberThere's two input files, in the first one you are given all primes under 10^6, in the second one lot of uniform randomly chosen primes.Warning: Time limit had been changed, and could not allows slow languages to get AC here. This problem allows easy coding using languages without bigNum library, but you need to be able to get at least some few points atFIB64.\r\nMy best C-timing is 0.12s. (Edit : 0.03s with cluster change)\r\nFor other languages, take a look atZ124Hwith higher constraints.Good luck, and have fun ;-)",
