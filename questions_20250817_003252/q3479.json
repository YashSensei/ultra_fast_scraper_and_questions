  "text": "f(n) is defined as: f(n) = 1k+2k+3k+ ... +nk, so it is the sum of the k-th power of all natural numbers up to n.In this problem you are about to compute,f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ... + f(n)InputThe first line is an integerT(1 ≤T≤ 54,321), denoting the number of test cases. Then,Ttest cases follow.For each test case, there are two integersn(1 ≤n≤ 123,456,789) andk(0 ≤k≤ 321) written in one line, separated by space.OutputFor each test case output the result of the summatory function described above.Since this number could be very large, output the answer modulo 1,234,567,891.ExampleInput:52 310 33 3100 0100 1Output:107942465050171700Warning: A naive algorithm may not run in timeSee also:Another problem added by Tjandra Satria Gunawan",
