  "text": "Special Thanks: Jane Alam Jan*At moment in University of Texas at San Antonio - USAYou will be givennintegersA1A2A3...An. Find a permutation of thesenintegers so that summation of the absolute differences between adjacent elements is maximized.Supposen = 4and the given integers are4 2 1 5. The permutation2 5 1 4yields the maximum summation. \tFor this permutationsum = abs(2-5) + abs(5-1) + abs(1-4) = 3+4+3 = 10.Of all the24permutations, you wonâ€™t get any summation whose value exceeds10. We will call this value,10, theelegant permuted sum.InputThe first line of input is an integerT(T< 100) that represents the number of test cases. Each case consists of a line that starts withn(1 <n< 51) followed by n non-negative integers separated by a single  space. None of the elements of the given permutation will exceed 1000.OutputFor each case, output the case number followed by theelegant permuted summation.ExampleInput:34 4 2 1 54 1 1 1 12 10 1Output:Case 1: 10Case 2: 0Case 3: 9",
