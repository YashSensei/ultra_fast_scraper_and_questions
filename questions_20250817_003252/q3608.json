You will have to buy them again. Before going to the market, you have decided that you will buynintegers in such a way that the value ofDwill be as small as possible, as you will have to payDgolden coins to buy them.Now, you are wondering, what that minimumDwill be. (Let's call itDmin).InputFirst line of the input file will contain the number of test cases,T ≤ 1000000, followed byTlines, each containing an integern(1≤n≤109).OutputFor each case, print the case number starting from 1 andDminfor the value ofnin that particular case. See the sample output for exact formatting.ExampleInput:3\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5Output:Case 1: 1\r\nCase 2: 0\r\nCase 3: 2Warning: Input file is huge, please use faster input and output methods (e.g. printf and scanf in C++).Problem Setter: Momontho Mashak MonmoySpecial Thanks: Muhammad Ridowan",
