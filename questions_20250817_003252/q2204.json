  "text": "After solvingFib-FactorizationandModFib-Period, you would probably be interested by solving this new task:Simply compute Fib(N) mod Fib(K), where Fib(N) denotes the Nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.(If N<2 Fib(N)=N, else Fib(N)=Fib(N-1)+F(N-2)).InputThe input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.In each of the next T lines there are two integers N, K.OutputFor each test case, on a single line, print Fib(N) mod Fib(K).ExampleInput:2\r\n5 5\r\n13 5Output:0\r\n3Constraints1 < T < 1051 < N < 10181 < K â‰¤ 103Edit (2017-02-11): New time limit (after compiler changes).",
