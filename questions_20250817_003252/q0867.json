Then you are given four types of query:Insert data to the list.Remove data from the list.Print an index (1-based) from a specified data after the list was sorted ascendingly.Print data from a specified index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly.InputInput contains several lines. Each line follows one of these formats.1 n: Insertn(0 ≤ n ≤ 231- 1) to the list.2 n: Removenfrom the list. Ifnwas not found, do nothing.3 n: Printn's index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly.4 i: Print data ati-th index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly (0 ≤ i ≤ 231- 1).-1: End of input.OutputFor each query 3, printn's index in one line. Ifnwas not found, just print -1.For each query 4, print data oni-th index in one line. If the index is not valid, just print -1.ExampleInput:3 20\r\n-1Output:-1",
