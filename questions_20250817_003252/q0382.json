  "text": "For each prefix of a given stringSwithNcharacters (each character has an ASCII code between 97 and 126, inclusive), we want to know whether the prefix is a periodic string. That is, for eachi(2 ≤i≤N) we want to know the largestK> 1 (if there is one) such that the prefix ofSwith lengthican be written asAK, that isAconcatenatedKtimes, for some stringA. Of course, we also want to know the periodK.InputThe first line of the input file will\r\ncontains only the numberT (1 ≤ T ≤ 10)of the test cases.Each test case consists of two\r\nlines. The first one containsN(2 ≤N≤ 1 000 000) – the size of the stringS.\r\nThe second line contains the stringS.OutputFor each test case, output “Test case #” and the consecutive test case\r\nnumber on a single line; then, for each prefix with lengthithat has a periodK> 1, output the prefix sizeiand the periodKseparated by a single space; the\r\nprefix sizes must be in increasing order. Print a blank line after each test case.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\naaa\r\n12\r\naabaabaabaabOutput:Test case #1\r\n2 2\r\n3 3\r\n\r\nTest case #2\r\n2 2\r\n6 2\r\n9 3\r\n12 4",
