  "text": "Orianna is a great swimmer and she's going to a swimming competition this month and needs your help as she is highly paranoic about the results of the competition.The competition consists in some sort of evaluations, every judge makes a score and, based on that score and the score of other contestants she will get a score belonging to her results, those scores are final, meaning that will not change in the competition.Orianna requires this solution with urgency, she is getting evaluated on a lot of ways and she is very worried about her results, so she wants to know what is the worst score from an evaluation A to other evaluation B inclusive.InputThe first line of the test data will start with an integer T representing the T test cases, then, T cases will follow, each of the cases starts with two integers N and Q, denoting the number of evaluations Orianna had, then, N integers will follow denoting the score on each evaluation, after that, Q queries will begin, each query consist on two integers A and B.OutputYou must output the string “Scenario #i:“, a blank line and then the result of each query, remember, Orianna is interested on the worst score from evaluation A to evaluation B inclusive.ExampleInput:2\r\n5 3\r\n1 2 3 4 5\r\n1 5\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n5 3\r\n1 -2 -4 3 -5\r\n1 5\r\n1 3\r\n2 4Output:Scenario #1:\r\n1\r\n1\r\n2\r\nScenario #2:\r\n-5\r\n-4\r\n-4Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 100Small input (30%):1 ≤ N ≤ 1,0001 ≤ Q ≤ 1,000-109≤ Ni ≤ 1091 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ NLarge input (70%):1 ≤ N ≤ 100,0001 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000-109≤ Ni ≤ 1091 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ N",
