  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is playing a games against her good friend Velvet Mite Vinit. They are playing a game which they call Fimber: There will be a few piles of seeds. In each move, the one who is in move can choose a pile and takeKseeds from it, whereKis equal to some Fibonacci number. They alternate in their turns. The one who can't move will lose.Fibonacci number will be defined asF0=1, F1=1,     FN=FN-1+FN-2As ladies go first Ada starts. Can you determine who will if both will play optimally?InputThe first line of each test-case will contain an integer1 ≤ N ≤     105, the number of piles.The next line will containNintegers0 ≤ Ai≤     3*106, the number of seeds in each pile.OutputFor each test-case, print the name of winner (so either \"Ada\" or \"Vinit\").Example Input6\r\n3 3 1 8 3 4Example OutputAdaExample Input1\r\n10Example OutputVinitExample Input4\r\n3 9 5 2Example OutputAdaExample Input5\r\n10 10 6 8 10Example OutputAdaExample Input1\r\n4Example OutputVinitExample Input4\r\n6 1 7 3Example OutputAdaExample Input5\r\n7 10 9 3 10Example OutputAdaExample Input6\r\n4 6 10 9 3 8Example OutputVinit",
