  "text": "A solid spherical ball of radiusRrolls without slipping on the inside surface of a fixed cone, whose tip points downward. The half-angle at the\r\nvertex of the cone isu. Initial conditions have been set up so that the ball travels around the cone in a horizontal circle of radiusl>R, \r\nwith the points on the ball that touch the cone tracing out a circle on the ball.Determine the radius of the circle of these contact points, if you want the sphere to travel around the cone as fast as possible.InputEach line of input has integersl(R < l ≤ 1000000)R(0 < R ≤ 1000) andu(0 < u < 90) given in degrees.OutputFor each line of input, output the radius of the circle of the contact points, round to integer.ExampleInput:220000 100 29Output:46Problem setter –  Wu, Xiaogang",
