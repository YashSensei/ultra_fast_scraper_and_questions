  "text": "You are given a matrix A of M rows and N columns, consisting of numbers 0 and 1. For a rectangle in A (sides ≥ 1), X1 is the number of ones on its sides, X0 is the number of zeros on its sides, and itsvalueis defined as X1 – X0. Let us consider W, the maximum value taken over submatrices of A, and S, the number of submatrices with value W. Your task is to find W and S.InputThe first line of input contains the number of test cases t (t ≤ 15).\r\nThe first line of each test case contains the numbers M, N (1 ≤ M, N ≤ 200) Then M lines follow. In each line, there are N numbers 0 or 1.OutputFor each test case, you should output a single line with numbers W and S.ExampleInput:1\r\n5 6\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1 0 0 0 0 1\r\n1 0 0 0 0 1\r\n1 0 0 0 0 1\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1Output:18 1",
