  "text": "Dr. Ellie Arroway has established contact with an extraterrestrial civilization. However, all efforts to decode their messages have failed so far because, as luck would have it, they have stumbled upon a race of stuttering aliens! Her team has found out that, in every long enough message, the most important words appear repeated a certain number of times as a sequence of consecutive characters, even in the middle of other words. Furthermore, sometimes they use contractions in an obscure manner. For example, if they need to saybabtwice, they might just send the messagebabab, which has been abbreviated because the secondbof the first word can be reused as the firstbof the second one.Thus, the message contains possibly overlapping repetitions of the same words over and over again. As a result, Ellie turns to you, S.R. Hadden, for help in identifying the gist of the message.Given an integerm, and a strings, representing the message, your task is to find the longest substring ofsthat appears at leastmtimes. For example, in the messagebaaaababababbababbab, the length-5 wordbababis contained 3 times, namely at positions 5, 7 and 12 (where indices start at zero). No substring appearing 3 or more times is longer (see the first example from the sample input). On the other hand, no substring appears 11 times or more (see example 2).In case there are several solutions, the substring with the right-most occurrence is preferred (see example 3).InputThe input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a line with an integerm(m≥ 1), the minimum number of repetitions, followed by a line containing a stringsof length betweenmand 40 000, inclusive. All characters insare lowercase characters from “a” to “z”. The last test case is denoted bym= 0 and must not be processed.OutputPrint one line of output for each test case. If there is no solution, outputnone; otherwise, print two integers in a line, separated by a space. The first integer denotes the maximum length of a substring appearing at leastmtimes; the second integer gives the right-most possible starting position of such a substring.ExampleInput:3\r\nbaaaababababbababbab\r\n11\r\nbaaaababababbababbab\r\n3\r\ncccccc\r\n0Output:5 12\r\nnone\r\n4 2Problem setter: David García Soriano",
