  "text": "Gopu is interested in the integer co-ordinates of the X-Y plane (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100000). Each integer coordinate contain a lamp, initially all the lamps are in off mode. Flipping a lamp means switching it on if it is in off mode and vice versa. Maggu will ask Gopu 3 type of queries.Type 1: x l r, meaning: flip all the lamps whose x-coordinate is between l and r (both inclusive) irrespective of the y coordinate.Type 2: y l r, meaning: flip all the lamps whose y-coordinate is between l and r (both inclusive) irrespective of the x coordinate.Type 3: q x y X Y, meaning: count the number of lamps which are in 'on mode' (say this number be A) and 'off mode' (say this number be B) in the region where x-coordinate is between x and X (both inclusive) and y-coordinate is between y and Y (both inclusive).InputFirst line contains Q-number of queries that Maggu will ask to Gopu. (Q ≤ 100000)Then there will be Q lines each containing a query of one of the three type described above.OutputFor each query of 3rd type you need to output a line containing one integer A.ExampleInput:3\r\nx 0 1\r\ny 1 2\r\nq 0 0 2 2Output:4",
