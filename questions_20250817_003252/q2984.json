  "text": "As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She decided to plant two similar rows of of tulips. She bought2×Nseeds ofLdifferent colors and planted them (in both rows) in such way, that the tulip of some color wasLunits far from nearest tulip of the same color. As Ada is also a mathematician, she gave you a more formal description: Theithposition had colori % L(where % stands for modulo).Even though she tried hard, she didn't expect the power of nature. A hurricane appeared and permuted the seeds in both rows (each seed remained in the same row, but got possibly different position in it). Now the tulips grew but the rows doesn't have the same sequences of colors.Ada doesn't like that, so she wants to rip off the least number of tulips so that both rows will have same sequence of colors.InputThe first line contains an integer1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, the number of test-cases.Each of the nextTtest-cases begins with two integers:N, L(1 ≤ L ≤  N ≤ 2×105), the number of tulips and the number of colors.Each of next2lines will containNintegers0≤     Ai< L, the colors of tulips.As Ada likes diversity, so she also assures you thatN/L(integer division) won't exceed100.The sum ofNover all test-cases won't exceed106OutputFor each test-case output the minimal number of tulips, which has to be ripped to achieve same sequencesExample Input4\r\n4 4\r\n1 2 3 0\r\n0 3 2 1\r\n5 2\r\n0 1 1 0 0\r\n1 1 0 0 0\r\n3 1\r\n0 0 0\r\n0 0 0\r\n6 3\r\n0 0 1 2 2 1\r\n1 2 0 2 0 1Example Output6\r\n2\r\n0\r\n4",
