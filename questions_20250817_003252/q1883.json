  "text": "Luis is playing his old metroid game. Just a little while ago he pass trough a scenario where the  room was filled with some amoeba-like creatures. The room started with some initial number  of creatures, but they multiply their selves very quickly, because their growth rate is proportional to the number of creatures at a certain time. Luis took note about this fact, he wrote  the number of creatures at the initial time, and then, after wait t time units, he wrote the new  amount. Now Luis wants to know, for a certain number of creatures p, the exact time he has  to be in the room to see that amount.InputThe first line contains an integer T, which specifies the number of test cases. Then, will follow  the descriptions of T test cases.For each test case, there will be 2 lines, the first one will contain 4 integers, p0, p1, t and p.  These numbers represents the initial amount of creatures, the second amount of creatures,  the time units that Luis waited to see that change, and the number of creatures that Luis wants  to see.OutputFor each input case you must print a single line containing the string \"Scenario #i:\" where i is the number of the test case (starting at one), and then the answer to the problem rounded to two decimal places. There will always  be an answer.ExampleInput:4\r\n10 15 3 15\r\n10 15 3 20\r\n5 12 2 50\r\n5 12 2 7Output:Scenario #1: 3.00\r\nScenario #2: 5.13\r\nScenario #3: 5.26\r\nScenario #4: 0.77Constraints1 ≤ T, p0, p1, t, p ≤ 100",
