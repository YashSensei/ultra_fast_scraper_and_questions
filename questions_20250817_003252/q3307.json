  "text": "EnglishVietnameseX and Y are playing the following game:\r\nThey start with an empty 2×N board and move alternately. X moves first. In a move, a player must place an L-triomino (shown on the right), in any of the 4 possible orientations, on the board. The piece placed must not overlap with a piece that has already been placed. The player that is unable to make a valid move loses.Given the size of the board, find out who will win the game assuming that both X and Y play optimallyInputInput consists of multiple test-cases. The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. (T ≤ 50)Each test-case consists of a single line containing a single integer N, the size of the board. (N ≤ 800)OutputFor each test-case, output a single line containing \"X\" or \"Y\" depending on who wins that game.ExampleInput:2\r\n3\r\n4Output:X\r\nY",
