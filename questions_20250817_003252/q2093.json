  "text": "John hasnlight bulbs and a switchboard withnswitches; each bulb can be either on or off, and pressing thei−th switch changes the state of bulbifrom on to off, and viceversa. He is using them to play a game he has made up. In each move, John selects a (possibly empty) set of switches and presses them, thus inverting the states of the corresponding bulbs. Initially all lights are off, and after exactlymmoves John would like to have the firstvbulbs on and the rest off; otherwise he loses the game. There is only one restriction: he is not allowed to press the samesetof switches in two different moves.This is quite an easy game, as there are lots of ways of winning. This has encouraged him to keep playing different winning games, and now he is intent on trying them all. Help him count how many ways of winning there are. Two games are considered the same if, after a reordering of the moves in one of them, at every step the same set of switches is pressed in both of them.For example, ifn= 4,m= 3, andv= 2, one possible winning game is obtained by pressing switches 1, 2 and 4 in the first move, 1 and 3 in the second one, and 1, 3 and 4 in the last one. This is considered equivalent to, say, first pressing 1 and 3; then 1, 2, 4; and then 1, 3, 4.InputThe input has at most 500 lines, one for each test case. Each line contains three integersn(1 ≤n≤ 1 000),m(1 ≤m≤ 1 000), andv(0 ≤v≤n). The last line of input will hold the values0 0 0and must not be processed.OutputPrint one line for each test case containing the number of ways John can play the game, modulo the prime 10 567 201.ExampleInput:3 3 1\r\n6 4 0\r\n6 4 3\r\n0 0 0Output:7\r\n10416\r\n9920Problem setter: David García Soriano",
