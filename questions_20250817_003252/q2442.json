Help the Ant find out if it can  reach the stickyfrom the stickx.InputThe first line of the input contains numbert– the amount of tests. Thenttest descriptions follow. The first line of each test contains two  integersnandm- the number of stick and the number of queries. Nextnlines contain four integersAx,Ay,Bx,By- the coordinates of the endpoints of a stick. You may consider stick to be straight segment on a plane.
