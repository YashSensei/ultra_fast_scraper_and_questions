  "text": "One of DB and TN common interests is traveling. One day, they went to Grand Line and found One Piece !The One Piece treasure has n gold coins (n is even). Both them like gold coins, but they evaluate them as different values. So they decided to divide those coins by following method :DB and TN do n / 2 steps, at each step, DB choose 2 coins, TN takes the coin that she evaluates it greater, and DB take the rest coin.Let’s help DB find how to take the maximum value at possible.InputFirst line : a single integer n (n is even) – the number of coinsSecond line : n integers a1, a2, …, an.aiis the value of ithcoin that TN evaluates.Third line : n integers b1, b2, …, bn.biis the value of ithcoin that DB evaluates.OutputFirst line : an integer S – the maximum value DB can take.Last n / 2 lines : ithline contains two number x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n), are the indexes of twocoins that DB choose on ithstep. Each coin must be chose exact one time.If there are multiple ways, just print any of them.Constraints2 ≤ n ≤ 500 0001 ≤ ai≤ 1091 ≤ bi≤ 109Note that a1, a2, …, anare n distinct integers.ExampleInput:6\r\n6 10 11 18 5 14\r\n1 7 6 12 15 1Output:28\r\n5 1\r\n2 6\r\n3 4Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
