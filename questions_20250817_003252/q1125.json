  "text": "Given two numbers n (1 ≤ n < 10100) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), you are to determine whether there exists a positive integer T which satisfies that for every positive integer a, na+T-nais divisible by 10k.InputMultiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated integers n and k. Input terminate by EOF.The number of test cases will not more than 20.OutputFor each test case, you should output the smallest positive integer number T which satisfies the condition above, or -1 if it doesn't exist.ExampleInput:32 2Output:4",
