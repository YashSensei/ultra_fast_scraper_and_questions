  "text": "During the next century certain regions on earth will experience severe water shortages. The old \r\ntown of Uqbar has already started to prepare itself for the worst. Recently they created a network of \r\npipes connecting the cisterns that distribute water in each neighbourhood, making it easier to fill them \r\nat once from a single source of water. But in case of water shortage the cisterns above a certain level \r\nwill be empty since the water will flow to the cisterns below.You have been asked to write a program to compute the level to which cisterns will be filled with a \r\ncertain volume of water, given the dimensions and position of each cistern. To simplify we will neglect \r\nthe volume of water in the pipes.TaskWrite a program that:reads the description of cisterns and the volume of water,computes the level to which the cisterns will be filled with the given amount of water,writes the result.InputThe first line of the input contains the number of data sets k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 30. The data sets follow.The first line of each data set contains one integer n, the number of cisterns, 1 ≤ n ≤ 50000. Each of \r\nthe following n lines consists of 4 nonnegative integers, separated by single spaces: b, h, w, d - the base \r\nlevel of the cistern, its height, width and depth in meters, respectively. The integers satisfy 0 ≤ b ≤ 106and 1 ≤ h×w×d ≤ 40000. The last line of the data set contains an integer V - the volume of water in \r\ncubic meters to be injected into the network. Integer V satisfies 1 ≤ V ≤ 2×109.OutputThe output should consist of exactly d lines, one line for each data set. \r\nLine i, 1 ≤ i ≤ d, should contain the level that the water will reach, in meters, rounded to two \r\nfractional digits, or the word \"OVERFLOW\" (without quotes), if the volume of water exceeds the total capacity of the cisterns.ExampleSample input:3 \r\n2 \r\n0 1 1 1 \r\n2 1 1 1 \r\n1 \r\n4 \r\n11 7 5 1 \r\n15 6 2 2 \r\n5 8 5 1 \r\n19 4 8 1 \r\n132 \r\n4 \r\n11 7 5 1 \r\n15 6 2 2 \r\n5 8 5 1 \r\n19 4 8 1 \r\n78Sample output:1.00 \r\nOVERFLOW \r\n17.00Warning: enormous Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages",
