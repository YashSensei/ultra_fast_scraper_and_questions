  "text": "We are given a sequence S of N distinct integers. Denote by S[i] as ith element of S.Hardik picks up a random permutation of S , breaks it into product of disjoint cycles & looks at cycle containing S[i].He notes down the sum of all element of this cycle. Call the expected value of this sum as cycleSum[i]. Your task is to find the minimum value amongst all cycleSums.Assume all permutations of these N numbers are equally likely.InputFirst line contains an integer T which denotes the number of test cases. Then follow description of T test cases. Each test case takes 2 lines. First line contains a single integer N, the size of S. Then follows second line containing N elements of S.OutputPrint the answer for each test case, rounded to exactly one decimal place, in one line each.ExampleInput:2\r\n1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n1 2Output:1.0\r\n2.0NoteNotion of cycles for any sequence is defined by using index in the sequence (1-N).Explanation of ExamplesIn first case only possible permutation is (1) So answer is trivially 1.0In second case possible permutations are (1)(2) and (12). As both of these are equally likely, cycleSum[1] = 1/2 * 1 + 1/2 * (1+2) = 2.0And cycleSum[2] = 1/2 * 2 + 1/2 * (1+2) = 2.5. Smaller of these is 2.0, hence the answer.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 5001 ≤ N ≤ 5000All elements of S are distinct integers in range 0 to 105",
