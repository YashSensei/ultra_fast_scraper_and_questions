  "text": "There are N horizontal line segments in the plane.  The ith segment\r\nhas some height hi(which may be negative) and runs from x = aito x = bi(ai< bi).  Segments do not contain their endpoints.\r\nYou must draw a set of vertical lines (notelinesand notline segments) so that every given horizontal segment is\r\nintersected at least once and at most R times by vertical lines in such a way that R\r\nis minimized.InputThe first line of the input is N (1 ≤ N ≤ 400), the number of\r\nhorizontal line segments.  N lines then follow, where the ith line\r\nis \"aibihi\".  Each of ai,bi,hiare 32-bit signed\r\nintegers.  Horizontal segments may overlap.OutputYour output should consist of a single integer, the smallest value of\r\nR that is achievable, followed by a newline.ExampleInput:3\r\n0 1 5\r\n0 2 -2\r\n1 2 7Output:2",
