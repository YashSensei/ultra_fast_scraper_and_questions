  "text": "You will be given a weighted rooted tree, where root is node 1. For each subtree of that tree, you will have to compute the summation of lengths of all possible simple paths present in that subtree. Eventually you need to print the summation of those values modulo1000000007.Image of the tree in the first sample is given below.InputFirst line of input will contain an integerT (1 <= T <= 10)denoting the number of test cases. Each test case will begin with an integerN(1 <= N <= 100000), indicating number of nodes. The followingN-1lines will have three integers each,U(1 <= U <= N),V(1 <= V <= N),W(1 <= W <= 1000000000), which denotes that there is an edge in the tree from nodeUto nodeVhavingWweight.Input File is large. Use fast I/O methods.OutputFor each test case, print the case number then print the answer to the problem modulo1000000007in separate lines.ExampleInput:2\r\n7\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 3 2\r\n2 4 1\r\n2 5 4\r\n3 6 6\r\n3 7 8\r\n6\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 3 2\r\n1 4 4\r\n3 5 7\r\n3 6 1Output:Case 1: 212\r\nCase 2: 109Explanation of SampleExplanation of the 1stsample: Summation of lengths of all possible sample paths for each subtree is given below:1: 1742: 103: 284: 05: 06: 07: 0Explanation of the 2ndsample: Summation of lengths of all possible sample paths for each subtree is given below:1: 932: 03: 164: 05: 06: 0",
