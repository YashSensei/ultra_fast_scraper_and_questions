  "text": "Bhagat is student of CSE at ISM Dhanbad. In mid-semester exam somehow he was able to score full marks in Boolean algebra. So his profs doubt how can he score full marks. So profs decided to check his ability. They gave Bhagat a list studentâ€™s admission number and ask him to find total kaptiness (K) of list.Kaptiness is defined as or operation on every dukkerness(di) value. Dukkerness value is xor operation on every pair of number in list. As we all know Bhagat is not good in Boolean algebra. Can you help him to prove his profs that he can score full out of full in boolean algebra.Example:-If list contain three number 10, 15 and 17. Then there will be total 3 pairs.d1= 10 ^ 15 = 5;d2= 10 ^ 17 = 27;d3= 17 ^ 15 = 30;k = d1| d2| d3 ;K = 31;InputFirst line of input containN(2 <= N <= 106).Nis total number of admission number (ai) in list.Then followingNline will contain admission number. (0 <= ai<=1018)OutputOutput only one line containingK.ExampleInput:3\r\n10\r\n15\r\n17Output:31NOTE: Large input data.>test cases have been updated and all solutions are rejudged.",
