  "text": "Devlali numbers were an important coinage by Indian recreational mathematician D. R. Kaprekar.For any positive integer n, define d(n) as the sum of n and the digits of n. Eg, d(199) = 199 + 1 + 9 + 9 = 218.For a positive number m, if there exists no positive number r such that d(r) = m, then m is a Devlali number. First few Devlali numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, ... so on.A prime number falling in this family is called a Devlali Prime. First few Devlali Primes are 3, 5, 7, ... so on.InputFirst line contains integer Q.Next Q lines contain two integers A and B.OutputPrint Q lines, each listing number of Devlali Primes in range [A, B] (both inclusive.)Limits1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000000 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 1000000ExampleInput3\r\n1 3\r\n0 10\r\n5 8Output1\r\n3\r\n2",
