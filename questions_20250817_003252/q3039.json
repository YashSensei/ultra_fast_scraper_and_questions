  "text": "Ada the Ladybug lives on a bush. A typical bush consists of some fruits connected with branches. Ada wants to travel between some fruits. Problem is that each edge can stand only someXiweight (so if some         creature  with more weight would like to travel over the edge, it would         break and the creature would fall of the bush).Ada wants to make several travels so she asks you (for each such travel) to how many distinct fruits she can get?InputThe first line of each test-case will contain three integers2 ≤ N ≤     105, the number of  fruits,1 ≤ M ≤     2*105, the number of edges and1 ≤ Q ≤     3*105, the number of queries.The nextMlines will contain three integers0 ≤ a, b <     N (a ≠ b), the fruits which are connected by and edge and1 ≤     Xi≤ 105.The nextQlines will contain two integers0 ≤ a <     N, the fruit Ada starts in and1 ≤ Y ≤     105, her actual weight.NOTEMultiedges are allowed.OutputFor each query, output the number of fruits Ada can get to.Example Input4 4 3\r\n1 2 4\r\n2 3 3\r\n3 0 4\r\n0 1 3\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n1 5Example Output4\r\n2\r\n1Example Input8 10 8\r\n1 3 3\r\n1 2 2 \r\n3 5 1\r\n3 4 3\r\n2 4 7\r\n5 6 2\r\n4 6 8\r\n4 7 3\r\n7 0 1\r\n6 0 4\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n0 5\r\n6 6\r\n6 1\r\n2 3\r\n0 4\r\n5 2Example Output7\r\n1\r\n1\r\n3\r\n8\r\n7\r\n4\r\n8",
