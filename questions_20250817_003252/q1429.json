  "text": "N points are placed in the coordinate plane. Write a program which calculates in how many ways a right triangle can be formed by three of the given points. A right triangle is one in which one of the angles is 90 degrees.InputThe first line of input contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 1500), the number of points. Each of the following N lines contains the coordinates of one point, two integers separated by a space. The coordinates will be between -109and 109. No two points will be located at the same coordinates.OutputOutput the number of right triangles.SampleInput:5\r\n-1 1\r\n-1 0\r\n0 0\r\n1 0\r\n1 1Output:7Input:4\r\n5 0\r\n2 6\r\n8 6\r\n5 7Output:0",
