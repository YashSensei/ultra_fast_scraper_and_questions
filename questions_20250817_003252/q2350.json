  "text": "There're given 5 points in 3D coordinates (integers 0 <= x, y, z < 100). Their order is arbitrary. 4 of them are the vertices of a tetrahedron whose edges can be of different size. One is lying in this tetrahedron. Find its index (1-5) in the array of points.InputIn the first line the number T (T<1000) of test cases.Then for each test case 5 lines with the space separated x-, y- and z-coordinates of the 5 points.OutputFor each test case a line with the index of that point which is lying in the tetrahedron formed of the 4 other points.ExampleInput:15 72 6692 23 6860 60 4974 78 3367 76 27Output:3",
