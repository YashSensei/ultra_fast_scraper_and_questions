  "text": "Given an integer array of N integers, find the sum of bit differences in all the pairs that can be formed from array elements. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is the count of different bits at the same positions in binary representations of x and y. For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2. Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 (first and last bits differ in two numbers).InputInput begins with a line containing an integerT (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing an integerN (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000), denoting the number of integers in the array, followed by a line containingNspace separated 32-bit integers.OutputFor each test case, output a single line in the formatCase X: Y, whereXdenotes the test case number andYdenotes the sum of bit differences in all the pairs that can be formed from array elements modulo10000007.ExampleInput:1\r\n4\r\n3 2 1 4Output:Case 1: 22",
