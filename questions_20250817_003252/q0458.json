  "text": "Sankalp's obsession for GCD is increasing day by day. Now he came up with this GCD question.Thegoodnessof array is defined as the product of sum of all the elements of the array and GCD of all the elements of the array.In other wordsgoodnessof arraytempof size k is equal to (temp[1] + temp[2] + ... + temp[k]) * gcd(temp[1], temp[2] ... temp[k]).In this task you will be given an array and you have to find the sum ofgoodnessof all non-empty subsequences of the given array.Since the answer can be very large output it modulo 1 000 000 007 (1e9+7).Definition of:SubsequenceInputFirst line of the input is the number of elements in the given array.Next line contains space separated array elements.OutputOutput the sum ofgoodnessall the non-empty subsequences of the given array modulo 1e9+7.Constraints1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 0001 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1 000 000ExampleInput:4\r\n2 4 6 9Output:350ExplanationThere will be 15 non-empty subsequences of the given array given as [2], [4], [6], [9], [2, 4], [2, 6], [2, 9], ...too lazy to write them all:PRequired ans = 2*2 + 4*4 + 6*6 + 9*9 + 6*2 + 8*2 + 11*1 + ... = 350.Let me know in the comments if it doesn't match:P",
