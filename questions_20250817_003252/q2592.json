  "text": "You are givenKpoints with positive integer coordinates. You are also givenMtriangles, each of them having one vertex in the origin and the other 2 vertices with non-negative integer coordinates.You are asked to determine for each triangle whether it has at least one of theKgiven points inside. (None of the K points are on any edge of any triangle.)InputThe first line of the input file will containKandM. The followingKlines will contain 2 positive integersxyseparated by one space that represent the coordinates of each point. The nextMlines have 4 non-negative integers separated by one space, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), that represent the other 2 vertices of each triangle, except the origin.OutputThe output file should contain exactlyMlines. Thek-th line should contain the characterYif thek-th triangle (in the order of the input file) contains at least one point inside it, orNotherwise.Constraints1 ≤K,M≤ 100 0001 ≤ each coordinate of theKpoints ≤ 1090 ≤ each coordinate of the triangle vertices ≤ 109Triangles are not degenerate (they all have non-zero area).In 50% of the test cases, all triangles have vertices with coordinatesx1 = 0andy2 = 0. That is, one edge of the triangle is on thex-axis, and another is on they-axis.if (0, 0), (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are 3 vertices of the query triangle and x1 < x2, then y1 > y2.ExampleInput 1:4 3\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n5 1\r\n5 3\r\n1 4 3 3\r\n2 2 4 1\r\n4 4 6 3Output 1:Y\r\nN\r\nYInput 2:4 2\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n5 1\r\n4 3\r\n0 2 1 0\r\n0 3 5 0Output 2:N\r\nYExplanation for Example 1Explanation for Example 2CEOI 2009 - Tîrgu Mureş, Romania",
