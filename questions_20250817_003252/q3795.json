  "text": "You are given a set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦, 2n-1, 2n} where n is an integer. You have to find the number of interesting subsets of this set X.A subset of set X is interesting if there are at least two integers a and b such that b is a multiple of a, i.e. remainder of b divides by a is zero and a is the smallest number in the set.InputThe input file contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input is an integer T (<= 30) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains an integer 'n' where 1<=n<=1000.OutputFor each test case, you have to output as the format below:Case X: YHere X is the test case number and Y is the number of subsets. As the number Y can be very large, you need to output the number modulo 1000000007.ExampleInput:3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3Output:Case 1: 1\r\nCase 2: 9\r\nCase 3: 47",
