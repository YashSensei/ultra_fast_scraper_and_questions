  "text": "A good drink is always served on ice.\r\nThat said, the amount of ice is what makes the difference.\r\nIf it is too much, the drink will be well cooled, however, this is a bit of fraud as there could be less ice (and more Vodka for example).\r\nOn the other hand, if there is too little ice the drink is warm which is unacceptable.\r\nYou are to help the bartender, of course neither with mixing nor drinking, but with calculating the expected outcome of such mixtures.To make things easier, we assume that pure water is mixed with ice in a closed system, i.e., there is no problem with the outside temperature or the warming of the bottle, etc.\r\nTherefore, after a some time has passed, the system may be regarded as balanced (there is no further change in temperature and no more melting or freezing).\r\nYour job is to calculate the final temperature of this balanced system and the amount of ice and water in this equilibrium state.As you know from physics, it takes 4.19 Joule to heat one gram of water one Kelvin, whereas it takes 2.09 Joule if it is ice.\r\nWe define the capacitiescw= 4.19 J/(g*K)andci= 2.09 J/(g*K).\r\nMelting one gram of ice takes 335 Joule, where the temperature remains constant at zero.\r\nWe define the constantem= 335 J/g.\r\nThe total thermal energy of the ice and the water before the experiment is equal to the thermal energy of the final mixture.The figure below shows the energy of one gram of ice, ice-water-mixture, or water, where the temperature is measured relative to -30 degrees Celsius.\r\nThe jump at 0 degrees represents the melting of ice to water.\r\nThe amount of energy gained is proportional to the amount of ice already melted.Input SpecificationThe input contains several test cases.\r\nEach test case consists of four real numbersmw, mi, tw, ti.\r\nThe mass of watermwand the mass of icemiare both non-negative, given in grams, andmw+ mi> 0.\r\nThe water temperaturetwand the ice temperaturetifollow, both given in degrees Celsius, and you may assume that-30 < ti<= 0 <= tw< 100.\r\nThe last test case is followed by four zeroes.Output SpecificationFor each test case output the amount of ice and water in grams and the final temperature of the mixture in degrees Celsius.\r\nAll numbers must be rounded to one digit.\r\nAdhere to the sample output for the exact format to use.Sample Input100 20 50 -10\r\n100 22 0  0\r\n100 35 25 -10.5\r\n10  90 25 -28\r\n0 0 0 0Sample Output0.0 g of ice and 120.0 g of water at 27.5 C\r\n22.0 g of ice and 100.0 g of water at 0.0 C\r\n6.0 g of ice and 129.0 g of water at 0.0 C\r\n100.0 g of ice and 0.0 g of water at -4.2 C",
