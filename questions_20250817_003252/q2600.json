  "text": "Your task is simple. A knight is placed on the top left corner of a chessboard having 2n rows and 2n columns. In how many ways can it move such that it ends up at a corner after at most K moves?InputThe first line contains T the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain 2 integers : n, kOutputOutput T lines, one for each test case, containing the required total number of configurations. Since the answers can get very big, output the answer modulo 1000007.ExampleInput:32 12 23 3Output:157Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 202 ≤ n ≤ 121 ≤ k ≤ 1000000000",
