  "text": "The Institute of Circles with Perimetral Connections (ICPC) has recently discovered that\r\nseveral machines that were working in their diverse productive areas were totally obsolete.\r\nOf course, all machines in the Institute contain several circles.The Supreme Chief Director Manager President of the ICPC asked their Computer Aided\r\nProblem Solving department to help in overcoming this situation. They have signalled\r\nyou as the maximum responsible, so you better get to work.Many machines in the Institute have mechanical parts in the shape of a circle that need\r\nto be rotated clockwise in order for the machine to work. Currently, each circular part\r\nis connected to a different electrical engine that does the job. You noted, however, that\r\nwhen many circles are coplanar, you can connect them with elastic bands and they will\r\nrotate all together with the energy of one engine.This marvellous idea lead you to a new problem. What’s the optimal way to connect\r\nall the circles? In general, there are many ways to place elastic bands and make all the\r\ncircles be connected. Since some of the rotating power of the system is lost in the tension\r\nof the elastic bands, you want to minimize the total length of elastic bands used.\r\nFormally, the length of the elastic band that connects two circles is the perimeter of the\r\nsmallest convex area that contains both circles. The total length is the sum of the lengths\r\nof all used elastic bands. Two circles can be connected with an elastic band even if the\r\nband touches or goes through any number of other circles or elastic bands.InputThe input contains several test cases, each one described in several lines. The first line\r\ncontains an integer N indicating the number of circles to connect (2 ≤ N ≤ 3000). Each\r\nof the next N lines describes a different circle using three integers X, Y and R separated\r\nby single spaces (1 ≤ X, Y, R ≤ 106). The values X and Y represent the coordinates of\r\nthe centre of the circle in the XY plane, while the value R indicates its radius. You may\r\nassume that within each test case no two circles overlap or touch each other. The last\r\nline of the input contains a single −1 and should not be processed as a test case.OutputFor each test case output a single line containing a real number representing the minimum\r\ntotal length of elastic band needed to connect all the circles. Round the result to the\r\nclosest rational number with three decimal places. In case of ties, round up. Always use\r\nexactly three digits after the decimal point, even if it means finishing with a zero.ExampleInput:3\r\n2 2 2\r\n1 6 1\r\n6 1 1\r\n2\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 4 1\r\n-1Output:35.829\r\n12.283",
