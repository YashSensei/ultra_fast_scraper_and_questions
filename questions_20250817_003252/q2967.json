  "text": "Sameen has:An array having N integers,Q friends.His friends are curious about the array. So, each of his friends asks Sameen a question about the array. Every question is described by 3 integers: i, j and k. In reply to a question, Sameen has to say the “k alternating sum” of the subarray starting at position i and ending at position j [1 based indexing].“k alternating sum” of a subarray starting at position i and ending at position j can be calculated in the following way:Add the first k numbers [starting from position i]Subtract the second k numbers [starting from position i+k]Add the third k numbers [starting from position i+2*k]Subtract the fourth k numbers [starting from position i+3*k]And so on till adding/subtracting the j-th number…(j-i+1) will be divisible by k.[See sample Input/output and explanation section for more details]Can you help Sameen in answering the questions?InputThe first line of input contains two integers N and Q. The next line contains N integers, the numbers in the array. Then each of the following Q lines contains 3 integers i, j and k.OutputFor each query output an integer in a separate line, the answer for that query. Queries should be answered in the order given in the input.Constraints:1 ≤ k ≤ 1000001 ≤ N ≤ 1000001 ≤ Q ≤ 100000-1000000000 ≤ Value of a number in the array ≤ 1000000000(j-i+1) will be divisible by k.ExampleInput:6 6\r\n4 1 -2 -3 4 5\r\n2 5 2\r\n1 6 1\r\n1 6 3\r\n1 6 6\r\n3 3 1\r\n3 4 1Output:-2\r\n3\r\n-3\r\n9\r\n-2\r\n1ExplanationIn the first query, the subarray is [ 1, -2, -3, 4].So “2 alternating sum” is equal to: [1-2]-[-3+4] = -2For the second query, we get [4]-[1]+[-2]-[-3]+[4]-[5] = 3N.B: Dataset is huge. Use faster I/O method.",
