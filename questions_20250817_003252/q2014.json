  "text": "You are studying a swarm ofNfireflies. Each firefly is moving in a straight line at a constant speed. You are standing at the center of the universe, at position (0, 0, 0). Each firefly has the same mass, and you want to know how close the center of the swarm will get to your location (the origin).You know the position and velocity of each firefly at t = 0, and are only interested in t ≥ 0. The fireflies have constant velocity, and may pass freely through all of space, including each other and you. Let M(t) be the location of the center of mass of theNfireflies at time t. Let d(t) be the distance between your position and M(t) at time t. Find the minimum value of d(t), dmin, and the earliest time when d(t) = dmin, tmin.InputThe first line of input contains a single integerT, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line that contains an integerN, the number of fireflies, followed byNlines of the formx y z vx vy vzEach of these lines describes one firefly: (x, y, z) is its initial position at time t = 0, and (vx, vy, vz) is its velocity.OutputFor each test case, outputCase #X: dmintminwhereXis the test case number, starting from 1. Any answer with absolute or relative error of at most10-6will be accepted.LimitsAll the numbers in the input will be integers.1 ≤T≤ 100The values of x, y, z, vx, vy and vz will be between -5000 and 5000, inclusive.Large dataset3 ≤N≤ 500SampleInput3\r\n3\r\n3 0 -4 0 0 3\r\n-3 -2 -1 3 0 0\r\n-3 -1 2 0 3 0\r\n3\r\n-5 0 0 1 0 0\r\n-7 0 0 1 0 0\r\n-6 3 0 1 0 0\r\n4\r\n1 2 3 1 2 3\r\n3 2 1 3 2 1\r\n1 0 0 0 0 -1\r\n0 10 0 0 -10 -1OutputCase #1: 0.00000000 1.00000000\r\nCase #2: 1.00000000 6.00000000\r\nCase #3: 3.36340601 1.00000000NotesGivenNpoints (xi, yi, zi), their center of the mass is the point (xc, yc, zc), where:xc= (x1+ x2+ ... + xN) / N\r\nyc= (y1+ y2+ ... + yN) / N\r\nzc= (z1+ z2+ ... + zN) / N",
