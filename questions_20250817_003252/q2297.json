  "text": "During a meeting with professors in the Asian Confederation of Mathematics, a Russian professor came up with a problem:He choose a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1018), then write all the numbers from 1 to N to form a continuous string of digits. Next he replaced substrings of identical digits with a single digit. For example string fragment \"14445556677666\" would be changed to \"145676\". Then he asked his fellow professors: given a length of string S determine the number N which results in that kind of string S. Can you help the professors?Your task: write a program to help your country's mathematicians.InputA single number M, length of the string S (1 ≤ M ≤ 1018.)OutputA single number N, the number which Russian professor selected.ExampleInput:13Output:12Explanation:With N = 12, we get the string: 123456789101112.Because there are three consecutive number ones, we delete the first two numbers, then we have: 1234567891012. The length of this string is 13",
