  "text": "Have you felt bored when counting triangles?Like TRICOUNT and TCOUNT2, we define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:And now we will continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagram. It's called level N hexagram if itâ€™s joined by 12 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.Task:All you have to do is to count all triangles in the level N hexagram.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the hexagram in that test case.OutputFor each test case, you should write a separate line: the number of triangles in the level N hexagram. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit positive integer)ExampleInput:1\r\n1Output:20The author allows only few languages",
