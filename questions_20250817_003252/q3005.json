  "text": "Problem setter of INSOMNIA, MNNIT Allahabad decided to set a easy problem for all coders so that they can easily solve the problem and boost their confidence for rest of INSOMNIA.The problem is a follows: You are given an array of size n which is initialized with 0. You will be given q queries of two types:Type 1: set in (input value) index k to -1.Type 2: print the index which has value -1 and is greater or equal to input index y. If there is no such value print -1.Note: Indexing is 1 based.InputFirst line contains two integers n and q separated by spaces.Next q lines contains type of query and for type 1 query integer k separated by a space and for type 2 integer y separated by a space.1 ≤ n ≤ 1061 ≤ q ≤ 1061 ≤ y, k ≤ nOutputPrint a single line for each query type 2 containing index which has value -1 and is greater or equal to input index y.ExampleInput:5 5\r\n2 3\r\n1 2\r\n2 1\r\n2 3\r\n2 2Output:-1\r\n2\r\n-1\r\n2",
