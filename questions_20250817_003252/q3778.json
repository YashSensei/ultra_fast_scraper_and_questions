  "text": "Ileana D'Cruz is taking programming classes but she is having problem in understandingwhile loops. She is working on following set of instructions -INTEGERI = 0, S, U = 1010;WHILE(I < U){S = (3 * S) + (5 * I);I = I + 1;}LetSkbe the value assigned to INTEGERSfor the iterationI = (k + 1)andn, m, pbe positive integers such thatm > n.Ileana knows the values ofnandmbut she forgot the initial value ofS. She is trying to find the unit digit ofp. Any initial value of S may be used. She also knows the following equality -(2 * n + 3) * (p - 1)+(4 / 5) * [(p * Sn) - Sm]=2 * (m - n)InputFirst line of input isT(total number of test cases). Each of next T lines contains two integersnandm.OutputPrintunit digit of p (p % 10)for each test case in separated lines.ExampleInput:1\r\n2 3Output:3ConstraintsT < 10001ExplanationLet S = 2S0= 6S1= 23S2= 79S3= 252Now solving the equation givesp = 3.",
