  "text": "We call a cuboidregularif:one of its vertices is a point with coordinates (0, 0, 0),edges beginning in this vertex lie on the positive semi-axes of the coordinate\r\n  system,the edges are not longer than 106There is given a setAof points of space, whose coordinates are integers\r\nfrom the interval\r\n[1..106]. We try to find a regular cuboid of maximal volume which does not\r\ncontain any of the points from the setA. A point belongs to the cuboid\r\nif it belongs to the interior of the\r\ncuboid, i.e. it is a point of the cuboid, but not of its wall.TaskWrite a program which:reads from the standard input the coordinates of points from the setA,finds one of the regular cuboids of maximal volume which does not contain any points from the setA,writes the result to standard output.InputInput begins with a line containing integer t ≤ 10, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.In the first line of each test case one non-negative integernis written\r\n(n≤5000). It is the number of elements in the setA. In the followingnlines of the input there are triples of integers from the interval\r\n[1..106], which are the X, Y and Z coordinates of points fromA, respectively. Numbers in each line are separated by single spaces.OutputFor each test case there should be three integers separated by single\r\nspaces. These are the X, Y and Z coordinates (respectively) of the vertex of the\r\nregular cuboid of maximal volume. If there is more than one such a cuboid, choose whichever. We require that all coordinates be positive.ExampleInput:1\r\n4\r\n3 3 300000\r\n2 200000 5\r\n90000 3 2000\r\n2 2 1000Output:1000000 200000 1000",
