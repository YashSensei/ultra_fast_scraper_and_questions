The map states the distancedijbetween each (connected) pair of planetsiandj, but due to the rapid technical evolution of this time, you estimate the travel time fromitojisdij/twheretis the time at which you choose to depart fromi. (It is impossible to travel at t=0).InputThe first line containsTthe number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains integerst0,N,Mwheret0is the time at which you start your trip. 0 ≤t0≤ 109Nis the number of planets in your system, numbered 0...N-1. 0 <N≤ 2.5×105Mis the number of connections between planets. 0 <M≤ 2.5×105The followingMlines of each test case contain integersi,j,dwhereiis the source planet. 0 ≤i<Njis the destination planet. 0 ≤j<Ndis the distance fromitoj. 0 ≤d≤ 109OutputThe arrival time at planetN-1 when starting at planet 0 at timet0, or \"Impossible\" (quotes for emphasis) if there is no possible route.ExampleInput:2\r\n0 5 5\r\n0 2 2\r\n2 3 3\r\n3 4 4\r\n0 1 5\r\n1 4 6\r\n0 2 1\r\n1 1 0Output:4.91760625098\r\nImpossible",
