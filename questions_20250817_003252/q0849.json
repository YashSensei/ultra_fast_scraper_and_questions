  "text": "Ada the Ladybug just got an innovative idea (which might be a rival of captcha): She made following function -F(a) = least significant 1-bit of a(indexed from 1). She also made following recursive functionT(N) = F(N×(N-1))3+ T(N-2), whereT(0) = 0, T(1) = 0.Her idea is following- Instead of asking for captcha, she uses an opposite method: She gives you evenNand you have to answerT(N)- if your answer is correct, then you are definitely a robot and you won't be let in.As her good friend she asked you to program a checker for her.InputThe input begins with an integer1 ≤ Q ≤ 106, number of queries.The nextQlines contains an even integer:2 ≤ N ≤ 2×108OutputFor each query, printT(N)Example Input5\r\n8\r\n4\r\n2\r\n20\r\n1000Example Output107\r\n35\r\n8\r\n310\r\n23988Little explanationF(2)=2\r\nF(12)=3\r\nF(30)=2\r\nF(56)=4\r\nF(90)=2\r\nF(132)=3\r\nF(182)=2\r\nF(240)=5\r\nF(306)=2\r\nF(380)=3",
