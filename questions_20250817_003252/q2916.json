  "text": "You are travelling to Kullu Manali, a hill station in India. You saw some huge mountains and very curious to climb the highest ones. Assume that there arenmountains of heighthigiven.But you were wondering about what could be the total height i need to climb if I climb only the mountain of maximum height only in a segment of k continuous mountains, considering all k segments possible. You want to calculate this for all k, such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.Mathematically, we need to find the sum of maximum element in each possible continuous segment of size k.InputThe first line contains an inputn.Thennnumbers follow, denoting the height ofithmountain.OutputOutputnlines, where ith line contains the sum of height of mountains to climb considering all continuous segments of sizei.Constraints:1 ≤ n ≤ 10000ExampleInput:5\r\n5 3 4 2 3Output:17\r\n16\r\n13\r\n9\r\n5ExplanationFor k=1, all the contiguous segments are (5), (3), (4), (2), (3). The total sum of maximum in each segment is 17 (5+3+4+2+3).For k=2, all the contiguous segments are (5, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (2, 3). The total sum of maximum in each segment is 16 (5+4+4+3).For k=3, all the contiguous segments are (5, 3, 4), (3, 4, 2), (4, 2, 3). The total sum of maximum in each segment is 13 (5+4+4).For k=4, all the contiguous segments are (5, 3, 4, 2), (3, 4, 2, 3). The total sum of maximum in each segment is 9 (5+4).For k=5, all the contiguous segments are (5, 3, 4, 2, 3). The total sum of maximum in each segment is 5 (5).",
