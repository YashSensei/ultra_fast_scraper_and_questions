At each successive  time  step,  the  computer  simultaneously transforms each digit 0 into  the  sequence 1 0 and each digit 1  into the sequence 0 1.So, after  the  first time step,  the sequence 0 1  is obtained; after the second, the sequence 1 0 0 1, after the third, the sequence 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 and so on.How many pairs of consecutive zeroes will appear in the sequence after n steps?InputClarification for this Problem: The Range of inputs is from 1 to 999 in some order and in particular not in ascending orderOutputFor each input n print the number of consecutive zeroes pairs that will appear in the sequence after n steps.SampleSample Input12345Sample output01135Notice : Long output - 1.45MB- there are a lot of input/output so it is easy to TLE if you don't optimize in/out if you use Java ...",
