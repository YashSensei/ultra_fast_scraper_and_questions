  "text": "Fascinated as he is by the uncanny world of electronics, our friend MKS now decides to launch his own creation â†’ A N-Digit Carry Finder (an analogue of a N-Bit Binary Adder) which can be used to find the number of times we can have a non-zero carry while adding two numbers (A = AnAn-1... A2A1and B = BnBn-1... B2B1) havingexactly Ndigits.It consists of 'N' Full Decimal Adders. The i-th Full Adder takes as input three digits Ai, Biand Ci-1and outputs a digit Ci(0 or 1), which is the carry generated on adding the digits Aiand Biand Ci-1. (Ci= 1 if Ai+ Bi+Ci-1> 9, otherwise 0).This Ciis now provided to the next (i+1-th) Full Adder in order to be added with the digits Ai+1and Bi+1and also to the accumulator which as the name suggests accumulates the sum of all Cj(1 <= j <= i).Note: C0= 0 always and 0 <= Ai, Bi<= 9.For Example: Adding two numbers, A = 4567 and B = 734 (or B = 0734), the addition proceeds as shown and the accumulator gets a final value of 3.In the 1st Adder, A1= 7, B1= 4, C0= 0 and A1+ B1+ C0= 11. Therefore Carry C1= 1.In the 2nd Adder, A2= 6, B2= 3, C1= 1 and A2+ B2+ C1= 10. Therefore Carry C2= 1.In the 3rd Adder, A3= 5, B3= 7, C2= 1 and A3+ B3+ C2= 13. Therefore Carry C3= 1.In the 4th Adder, A4= 7, B4= 0, C3= 1 and A4+ B4+ C3= 8. Therefore Carry C4= 0.The Value in the Accumulator = C1+ C2+ C3+ C4= 3.Your task is to find the number of ways of getting a valueKin theaccumulatorwhile adding two numbers containingat most Ndigits each. Note that we are adding the numbers in theirbase 10representation. Since the total number of ways can be very large, print your answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 +7).InputThe first line of input contains an integer T. Then T lines follow containing two space separated integers N and K.OutputPrint the required answer modulo 1000000007(10^9 +7) in the ithline corresponding to the ithTest case .Constraints1 <= T <= 5001 <= N <= 10001 <= K <= NExampleInput:4\r\n1 1\r\n2 1\r\n2 2\r\n3 3Output:45\r\n4500\r\n2475\r\n136125ExplanationFor test case 1, the carry appears when adding:1 and 9, 2 and 9, 3 and 9 ... 9 and 9 = 9 cases.2 and 8, 3 and 8, 4 and 8 ... 9 and 8 = 8 cases.3 and 7, 4 and 7, 5 and 7 ... 9 and 7 = 7 cases....9 and 1 = 1 case.There are (9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0) = 45 cases in total and in each case, the carry appears exactly once.",
