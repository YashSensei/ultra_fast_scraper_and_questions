  "text": "Leo didn't do all the job in hislast problem, somebody gave him the numbers in a convenient base. It was the bottleneck of the problem... Now your task is to do this job.InputThe first line of input contains three integersT, the number of test cases,B1, the first base,B2, the second base. \r\n \r\nFollow 2×Tlines.\r\nFor each test case, on the first line your are given one integerk.\r\nOn the second line you are givenkintegers : the digits ofNin baseB1.N = a0×B10+ ... + ai×B1i+ ... + ak-1×B1k-1OutputFor each test case, you have to print the numberNin baseB2.\r\nSee sample for details.ExampleInput:1 10 100\r\n5\r\n5 4 3 2 1Output:3\r\n45 23 1ExplanationsFor the lonely case, N = 5×100+ 4×101+ 3×102+ 2×103+ 1×104= 12345.\r\nWe have: N = 45×1000+ 23×1001+ 1×1002. You have to print 3, the number of digits,\r\n then the digits: 45, 23 and 1.Constraints0 < T <= 50\r\n1 < B1,B2 <= 10^9\r\n1 < k <= 10000\r\n0 <= ai< B1  , ak-1>0Time limit is sqrt(T_basic_pike_code * T_awaited_python_code) = sqrt(13.34*6.97), based on my Python3/Pike experiments.\r\nYou may try before thetutorial edition.Have fun ;-)Edit(2017-02-11) : With compiler updates, a new time limit is set.\r\nTime limit is sqrt(T_basic_pike_code * T_awaited_python_code) = sqrt(3.93*1.57), based on my Python3/Pike experiments.\r\nThanks @Blue_Mary for pointing this out.",
