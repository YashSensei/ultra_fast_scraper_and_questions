  "text": "Gunnar is quite an old and forgetful researcher. Right now he is writing a paper on security in social networks and it actually involves some combinatorics. He wrote a program for calculating binomial coefficients to help him check some of his calculations.A binomial coefficient is a numberwherenandkare non-negative integers.Gunnar used his program to calculateand got a numbermas a result. Unfortunately, since he is forgetful, he forgot the numbersnandkhe used as input. These two numbers were a result of a long calculation and they are written on one of many papers lying on his desk. Instead of trying to search for the papers, he tried to reconstruct the numbersn,kfrom the output he got. Can you help him and find all possible candidates?InputOn the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:one line with an integerm(2 ≤m≤ 1015): the output of Gunnar’s program.OutputPer test case:one line with an integer: the number of ways of expressingmas a binomial coefficient.one line with all pairs (n, k) that satisfy=m. Order them in increasing order ofnand, in case of a tie, order them in increasing order ofk. Format them as in the sample output.SampleInput:2\r\n2\r\n15Output:1\r\n(2,1)\r\n4\r\n(6,2) (6,4) (15,1) (15,14)",
