  "text": "EnglishVietnameseSolitaire has N elevators. Each elevator are connecting exactly two\r\nfloors and it does not stop on the floors between that two floors\r\nThe speed of all the elevators are the same, 5 seconds to pass one floor.On the beginning, each elevator is in its lower position and they\r\nare starting cruising to the upper floor. After some elevator come\r\nto its upper position, it immediately starts to go back to its lower\r\nposition, and so on...Mirko is on the first (the lowest) floor and he wants as quick as\r\npossible come to the top of the solitaire. He can change elevators\r\nonly on the floors that are common to both elevators, and if the other\r\nelevator is in that moment on that floor, that change\r\ndoes not take any time.Write a program that will calculate minimal time in which Mirko can get\r\nto the top of the solitaire.InputIn the first line of the input file there are two integers K\r\nand N, separated with space, number of floors in solitaire and\r\nnumber of elevators, 2 ≤ K ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ N ≤ 50000.In each of the next N lines there are description of one elevator,\r\ntwo integers A and B, separated with space, 1 ≤ A < B ≤ K, means that\r\nelevator is travelling between floors A and B.There are no two different elevators that travels between same floors.Note: input data will guarantee that solution will always exists.OutputIn the only line of output file write minimal time (in seconds) from\r\nthe text above.SampleInput:10 4\r\n1 5\r\n5 10\r\n5 7\r\n7 10Output:45Input:10 3\r\n1 5\r\n3 5\r\n3 10Output:105Input:20 5\r\n1 7\r\n7 20\r\n4 7\r\n4 10\r\n10 20Output:150",
