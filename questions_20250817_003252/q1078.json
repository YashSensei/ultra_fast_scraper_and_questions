  "text": "You are given an unweighted, undirected tree.\r\nWrite a program to output the length of the longest path (from one node to another) in that tree.\r\nThe length of a path in this case is number of edges we traverse from source to destination.InputThe first line of the input file contains one integerN– number of nodes in the tree\r\n(0 <N≤ 10000). NextN-1 lines containN-1 edges of that tree – Each line contains a pair (u,v) means\r\nthere is an edge between nodeuand nodev(1 ≤u,v≤N).OutputPrint the length of the longest path on one line.ExampleInput:3\r\n1 2\r\n2 3Output:2",
