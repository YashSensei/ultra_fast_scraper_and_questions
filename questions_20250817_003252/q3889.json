  "text": "A curd manufacturing factory owns curd producing machines of different qualities. A curd producer of quality q produces 1 unit of curd in q units of time.For example, a curd producer of quality 5 produces 1 unit of curd at time 5, 1 unit of curd at time 10 and so on.Given the qualities of all the machines, find the minimum time required to produce T units of curd.InputThe first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each testcase, the first line consists of 2 integers n and T, the number of machines and the target amount of curd. The next n lines consists of integers representing the qualities of the producer machines.OutputFor each test case, find the minimum time required to produce the target amount of curd.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 1021 ≤ n ≤ 1041 ≤ T ≤ 1091 ≤ quality of each machine ≤ 109Note:Note that a quality 5 producer has produced only 1 curd at time 9 and not 1.8.SampleInput:3\r\n2 3\r\n5\r\n10\r\n3 1000000\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n1 1000000000\r\n1000000000Output:10\r\n545455\r\n1000000000000000000",
