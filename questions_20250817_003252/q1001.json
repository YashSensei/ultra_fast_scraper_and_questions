  "text": "Mohib(), as we all known, is very brilliant in mathematics. His friendBarhas given him another problem to solve.Bar gives him a sequence of distinct positive integers, whose average is (A+1).If Bar append an integer x to the sequence, then the average of integers in the sequence will be A.He asked the Mohib to tell him the largest possible integer in the sequence.InputFirst line contains T, the number of testcases (T ≤ 5000).Next T lines contain an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 49999) and A (x+1 ≤ A ≤ 50000).OutputPrint the largest possible integer in the sequence.ExampleInput:1\r\n1 2Output:3",
