For each test case, the first line contains the integers N and M, and the second line contains the integers c1... cN.OutputFor each test case, output a single integer: the number of sequences described above, modulo 1,000,000,000.ExampleInput:1\r\n2 2\r\n3 2Output:1The only possible sequence is 2, 1.",
