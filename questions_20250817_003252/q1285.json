  "text": "Given two undirected trees T1 and T2 with equal number of vertices N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) numbered 1 to N, find out if they are isomorphic.Two trees T1 and T2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection f between the vertex sets of T1 and T2 such that any two vertices u and v of T1 are adjacent in T1 if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in T2.InputThe first line of input contains the number of test cases nTest (1 ≤ nTest ≤ 400). Each test case contains:The first line contains the number of nodes N.Each of next N-1 lines contain two integers A, B, denoting that there is an edge in T1 between nodes A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N).Each of next N-1 lines contain two integers A, B, denoting that there is an edge in T2 between nodes A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N).The sum of N over all test cases will not exceed 100,000.OutputFor each test case print YES if T1 and T2 are isomorphic and NO otherwise.ExampleInput:244 24 12 34 22 34 153 43 23 53 13 44 22 52 1Output:YESNO",
