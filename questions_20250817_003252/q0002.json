  "text": "You are to find all pairs of integers such that their sum is equal to the given integer number N and the second number results from the first one by striking out one of its digits. The first integer always has at least two digits and starts with a non-zero digit. The second integer always has one digit less than the first integer and may start with a zero digit.InputThe first line of the input file is the integer number t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20), the number of test cases. Then t lines follow, each test case in one line; the line consists of a single integer N (10 ≤ N ≤ 109).OutputFor each test case:On the first line write the total number of different pairs of integers that satisfy the problem statement. On the following lines write all those pairs. Write one pair on a line in ascending order of the first integer in the pair. Each pair must be written in the following formatX + Y = NHere X, Y, and N, must be replaced with the corresponding integer numbers. There should be exactly one space on both sides of '+' and '=' characters.ExampleInput:2\r\n302\r\n11Output:5\r\n251 + 51 = 302\r\n275 + 27 = 302\r\n276 + 26 = 302\r\n281 + 21 = 302\r\n301 + 01 = 302\r\n1\r\n10 + 1 = 11",
