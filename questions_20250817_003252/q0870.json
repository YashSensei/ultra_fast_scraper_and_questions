  "text": "Boss Baby is the boss of all babies. He has been exploring prime numbers lately, and new recently made a conjecture resembling one of Goldbach's conjectures. Boss baby’s conjecture is that any number greater than or equal 10 can be expressed as the sum of a prime, square of two prime. It’s very easy work for him but he is busy to stop the dastardly plot of the CEO of Puppy Co.  He wants your help verify his conjecture for small numbers.Note: 1 is not a prime number.InputThe first line of the input contains an integer T (T ≤ 106) denoting the number of test cases. Each test case  will consist of a number greater than 10 and less than 106, one per line.OutputFor each case, print the case number and the 3 primes P1, P2, P3on a line, where P1+ P22+ P32is equal to the number from the input. (P1, P2, P3must be printed in sort order.) If no such primes exist, print \"0 0 0\" instead (quotes for clarity). If there are multiple triplets of primes that satisfy the equation, print the least one in sorted order.SampleInput:3\r\n18\r\n20\r\n23Output:Case 1: 2 3 5\r\nCase 2: 2 3 3\r\nCase 3: 3 3 5NoteFor second Case 202, 3, 3 (2 + 32+ 32) = 202, 3, 7 (22+ 32+ 7) = 20are possible, but 2, 3, 3 is the least one",
