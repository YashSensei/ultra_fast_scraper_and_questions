  "text": "Apartitionof positive integer m into n components is any sequence a1... anof positive integers such that a1+ ... + an= m and a1≤ a2≤ ... ≤ an. \r\n\tYour task is to determine the partition, which occupies the k-th position in \r\n\tthe lexicographic order of all partitions of m into n components.The lexicographic order is defined as follows: sequence a1... ancomes before b1... bniff there exists such an integer \r\n\ti, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, that aj=bjfor all j, 1 ≤  j< i, and ai< bi.InputThe input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test \r\n\tcases follow.For each test case the input consists of three lines, containing the positive \r\n\tintegers m, n and k respectively (1 ≤ n ≤  10, 1 ≤  m ≤ 220, k is not \r\n\tlarger than the number of partitions of m into n components).OutputFor each test case output the ordered elements of the sought partition, \r\n\tseparated by spaces.ExampleInput:1\r\n9\r\n4\r\n3Output:1 1 3 4",
