  "text": "Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating poetical form. Tautograms are a special case alliteration, which is the occurrence of the same letter at the beginning of adjacent words. In particular, a sentence is a tautogram if all of its words start with the same letter.For instance, the following sentences are tautograms:Flowers Flourish from FranceSam Simmonds speaks softlyPeter pIckEd pePPerstruly tautograms triumphFiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this kind of sentences. Please help Fiona to check if each sentence she wrote down is a tautogram or not.InputEach test case is given in a single line that contains a sentence. A sentence consists of a sequence of at most 50 words separated by single spaces. A word is a sequence of at most 20 contiguous uppercase and lowercase letters from the English alphabet. A word contains at least one letter and a sentence contains at least one word.The last test case is followed by a line containing only a single character ‘*’ (asterisk).OutputFor each test case output a single line containing an uppercase ‘Y’ if the sentence is a tautogram, or an uppercase ‘N’ otherwise.ExampleSample input:Flowers Flourish from France\r\nSam Simmonds speaks softly\r\nPeter pIckEd pePPers\r\ntruly tautograms triumph\r\nthis is NOT a tautogram\r\n*Sample Output:Y\r\nY\r\nY\r\nY\r\nN",
