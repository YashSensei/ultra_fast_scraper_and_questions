  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is playingGame of Divisorsagainst her friend Velvet Mite Vinit. The game has following rules. There is a pile ofNstones between them. The player who's on move can pick at least1and at mostσ(N)stones (whereσ(N)stands for the number of positive divisors ofN). Obviously,Nchanges after each move. The one who won't get any stones (N == 0) loses.As Ada theLadybug is a lady, so she moves first. Can you decide who will be the winner? Assume that both players play optimally.InputThe first line of input will contain1 ≤ T ≤ 105, the number of test-cases.The nextTlines will contain1 ≤ N ≤ 2*107, the number of stones which are initially in pile.OutputOutput the name of winner, so either \"Ada\" or \"Vinit\".Example Input8\r\n1\r\n3\r\n5\r\n6\r\n11\r\n1000001\r\n1000000\r\n29Example OutputAda\r\nVinit\r\nAda\r\nAda\r\nVinit\r\nVinit\r\nAda\r\nAda",
