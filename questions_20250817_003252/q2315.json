  "text": "You are given a sequence ofnintegersa0, a1... an-1. You are also given several queries consisting of indicesiandj(0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n-1). For each query, determine the number of occurrences of the most frequent value among the integersai... aj.InputFirst line contains two integersnandq(1 ≤ n, q ≤ 100000). The next line containsnintegersa0... an-1(0 ≤ ai≤ 100000, for eachi ∈ {0 ... n-1}) separated by spaces. The followingqlines contain one query each, consisting of two integersiandj(0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n-1), which indicates the boundary indices for the query.OutputFor each query, print one line with one integer: The number of occurrences of the most frequent value within the given range.ExampleInput:5 31 2 1 3 30 21 20 4Output:212NOTE - This problem is similar to a problem Frequent values.",
