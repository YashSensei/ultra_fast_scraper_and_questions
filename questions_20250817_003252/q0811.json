  "text": "You will be given an array A. You can pick X (where X is aprime) consecutive elements from the array A so that the sum is maximized. Note that you can select multiple consecutive elements.For example, if you are given an array with 10 elements, then one of ways you can select elements by selecting 1st, 2ndelement then 4th, 5th, 6thelement then 8th, 9thelements.Another way can be to select 1stand 2ndelement then select 4-10 elements.InputThe first line of the input will be an integert,denoting the number of the test cases.For each test case, there will be an integern, denoting the size of the array A.Next line there will benintegers denoting the elements of the array A.OutputFor each test case, print the maximized sum (as discussed above) in a line.Constraints1 ≤ t ≤ 1001 ≤ n ≤ 20001 ≤ elements of the array A ≤ 100000SampleInput:2\r\n4\r\n1 2 3 4\r\n10\r\n10 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2Output:9\r\n21",
