  "text": "It's said: there can be miracles, when you believe. The following programming language shows the power of \"when\". It has a very simple (case insensitive) grammar, shown below:PROGRAM := WHEN | PROGRAM WHEN\r\nWHEN := 'when ' EXPRESSION <ENTER> STATEMENTS 'end when' <ENTER>\r\nSTATEMENTS := STATEMENT | STATEMENTS STATEMENT\r\nSTATEMENT := PRINT | SET\r\nPRINT := 'print '  EXPRESSION_LIST <ENTER>\r\nSET := 'set ' ASSIGNMENT_LIST <ENTER>\r\nEXPRESSION_LIST := EXPRESSION | EXPRESSION_LIST ',' EXPRESSION\r\nASSIGNMENT_LIST := ASSIGNMENT | ASSIGNMENT_LIST ',' ASSIGNMENT\r\nASSIGNMENT := VARIABLE '=' EXPRESSION\r\nEXPRESSION := '(' EXPRESSION OP EXPRESSION ')' | VARIABLE | NUMBER \r\nOP :=  '<' | '+' | '-' | 'and' | 'or' | 'xor'\r\nVARIABLE := '$' NOT_DOLLAR_STRING '$'\r\nNUMBER := DIGIT | NUMBER DIGIT\r\nDIGIT := '0' | .. | '9'\r\nNOT_DOLLAR_STRING := any sequence of printable characters (including blanks) \r\n                     that does not contain a $ symbol.In the above, any string enclosed in single quotes are to be treated literally.  <ENTER> is the end of line.In words, Spaces are allowed before or after any literal except inside a number. Spaces are allowed in variable names,  and each non-empty sequence of spaces is treated as a single underscore, so the following refer to the same variable:$Remote Switch#1$ \r\n$Remote_Switch#1$ \r\n$Remote   switch#1$All numbers appearing in the program will be integers between 0 and 1000000000, inclusive. All variable and literal values are integers between -1000000000 and 1000000000, inclusive.  All variables are global and initially zero.  The programs you will be tested on will never have anEXPRESSIONthat evaluates to a value outside of this range. The logical operators evaluate to 0 for false and 1 for true, and treat any nonzero value as true.Running the program amounts to executing all the active when clauses until none are active.  More specifically, the active list of when clauses is initially empty, then the following steps are repeated:In the order they appear in the program, the conditions of all when clauses that are not currently active are evaluated.  If true, the clause is added to the end of the active list, with its first statement marked as \"ready\".  Each active when clause has one \"ready\" statement.If the active list is empty after this step, the program terminates.The \"ready\" statement from the \"current\" when clause (initially the first clause in the active list) is executed.The statement marked as \"ready\" is advanced, removing the when clause from the active list if this is the last statement in the \"current\" when clause.The when clause marked as \"current\" is advanced, cycling to the beginning of the active list if the end is reached.In other words, inactive when conditions are evaluated to determine if these clauses are added to the active list.  Then one statement (set or print) is executed from the current active when clause.  If this is the last statement in that clause, it is removed from the active list.  One the next iteration, one statement is executed from the next active when clause, etc.A set statement executes all the assignments concurrently, so thatset $x$=$y$,$y$=$x$swaps the values of $x$ and $y$.  The same variable cannot appear twice on the left hand part of the same set statement (so set $x$=1,$x$=2 is illegal).A print statement evaluates and prints the given expressions in the output, separated by commas and followed by a new line.  Soprint 1,(2+3)results in the line1,5in the output.InputThe input consists of a single syntactically correct program.  You        may assume that the program will not execute more than 100000        set statements and 100000 print statements.OutputPrint the output produced by executing the given program. Both the input and output file will not exceed 100KB.ExampleInput:When ($Mr. Bill$<5)\r\n   Set $mr._bill$=($mr.  bill$+1),$Y$=($Y$+10)\r\nEnd When\r\nWhen ($mr. Bill$<10)\r\n  Set $MR. BILL$=($mr. bill$+1)\r\n  Print $mr. bill$,$Y$\r\nEnd WhenOutput:3,20\r\n6,40\r\n7,40\r\n8,40\r\n9,40\r\n10,40",
