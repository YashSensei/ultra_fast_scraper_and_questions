The array 'a' is a random permutation of numbers from 1..N chosen uniformly at random.InputFirst line contains t, the number of test cases. t lines follow, each containing N, the number of elements in the array.1 ≤ t ≤ 1001 ≤ n ≤ 100,000OutputFor each test case, output a single decimal. Your answer should be within 10-6of the correct answer.ExampleInput:1\r\n2Output:1.5ExplanationFor N = 2, you can have the following two permutations: [1, 2] and [2, 1].In the first case theifblock gets executed 2 times, and in the second case theifblock gets executed 1 time. So the expected value is (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5",
