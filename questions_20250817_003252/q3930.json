While travelling around in Bomber Nebula, they decided to spend some time  in the famous Bingeling Empire. To manage their expenses, they took up an internship under Dr. Ein, the scientist assisting the Bomberman.Unfortunately at the same time, Fiendish Bombers penetrated the defenses of the planet Bomber and have swarmed the entire empire. Consider the empire asN×N×Nmaze with each cell occupied by the enemy. You can also view it as a huge cube with sideN.The task of Jay and Nemo is now to guide the Bomberman to plant the bombs and destroy enemies. Because one of Dr. Ein's new invention, the Fire ability of the Bomberman’s bomb is infinite. That is, if it explodes at(x, y, z)it will destroy enemies in all the cells(*, y, z),(x, *, z)and(x, y, *). Since most of the resources of the empire are captured, they are left with onlyMbombs. Although being good computer scientists, they are exceptionally poor at visualising things in 3 dimensions. So they ask you,the greatest programmer ever to roam on Earth: Is is possible to defeat the invaders?InputThe first line containsT, the number of test cases. Each of the nextTlines contains 2 space separated integersNandM, denoting the size of the maze and the count of available bombs respectively.Output\"POSSIBLE\" or \"IMPOSSIBLE\"  depending upon each test case.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 1061 ≤ N ≤ 1070 ≤ M ≤ 1016ExampleInput:41 01 11 22 1Output:IMPOSSIBLEPOSSIBLEPOSSIBLEIMPOSSIBLEWarning: Large I/O.
