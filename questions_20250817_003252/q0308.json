  "text": "There are infinitely many coin denominations in the Byteland. They have values of 2ifor i=0, 1, 2 ... . We will say that set of coins c1, c2 ... ck is perfect when it is possible to pay every amount of money between 0 and c1 + ... + ck using some of them (so {4, 2, 2, 1} is perfect while {8, 1} is not). The question is - is it always possible to change given sum n into a perfect set of coins? Of course it is possible ;). Your task will be more complicated: for a sum n you should find minimal number of coins in its perfect representation.InputFirst line of input contains one integer c ≤ 50 - number of test cases. Then c lines follow, each of them consisting of exactly one integer n ≤ 101000.OutputFor each test case output minimal number of coins.ExampleInput:\r\n5\r\n507\r\n29\r\n8574\r\n233\r\n149\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n14\r\n7\r\n21\r\n11\r\n10",
