  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is currently growing plants. She has a very long furrow, in\r\nwhich she does so. It is so long, that most of water falling from rains drops\r\njust onto a part (segment) of the furrow. Ada doesn't want the plants to\r\nwither, so she records all rains to know, how much water every particular plant\r\ngot. Sadly, there are so many rains that she couldn't handle\r\nthis alone!At first, you will be givenNqueries with[L, R]segments\r\ntelling you, where all of theNrains fallen. AfterwardMqueries\r\nfollows, with numberi- the i-th plant for which you want to know, the\r\nnumber of rains, which has fallen onto it.InputThe first line will contain0 < N, M ≤ 105,0 < W ≤ 106, number of\r\nrains, number of questions and size of furrow respectively.ThenNlines follow, each containing two integers0 ≤ L ≤ R < W, symbolizing left and right plant in segment on which\r\ni-th rain has fallen.AfterwardMlines follow, each containing a number0 ≤ a < W, asking for number of rains which has fallen on plant numbera.OutputPrintMlines (for each query of second type), with integer indicating\r\nnumber of rains, which has fallen on the plant in query.Example Input6 7 10\r\n0 9\r\n3 5\r\n4 6\r\n4 8\r\n1 8\r\n5 5\r\n1\r\n5\r\n9\r\n4\r\n9\r\n6\r\n7Example Output2\r\n6\r\n1\r\n5\r\n1\r\n4\r\n3",
