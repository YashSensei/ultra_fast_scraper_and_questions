  "text": "There is a string containing only decimal digit characters. The length of the string is between1and1000. Using characters of the string, you have to construct the maximum number which divides by fifteen without remainder. Each character of the string may not be used more than once.InputFirst line of input contains an integert(1 ≤t≤ 90), equal to the number of test cases. Then descriptions ofttest cases follow.Each testcase is described in a single line representing the source string.OutputFor each test case output one line with the decimal representation of the maximum number. Leading zeroes should be omitted. If no number can be constructed, output a single word“impossible”.ExampleInput:1\r\n02041Output:4200",
