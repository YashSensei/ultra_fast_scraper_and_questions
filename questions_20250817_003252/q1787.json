Given the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron\r\ncalculate the radius of a sphere inscribed in that tetrahedron\r\n(i.e. a sphere tangent to all the faces).InputNumber N of test cases in a single line. (N â‰¤ 30)\r\nEach of the next N lines\r\nconsists of 6 integer numbers -- the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron\r\nseparated by single spaces. The edges are not longer than 1000 and\r\nfor the tetrahedron WXYZ, the order of the edges is: WX, WY, WZ, XY, XZ, YZ.OutputN lines, each consisting of a real number given with four digits decimal precision\r\nequal to the radius of a sphere inscribed in the given tetrahedron.ExampleInput:\r\n2\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1000 999 998 5 5 6\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n0.2041\r\n1.4189",
