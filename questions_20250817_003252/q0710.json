  "text": "Pompom bunny has N strange eggs. The i-th egg is broken by tapping it exactly Ai times. Pompom\r\nneeds to break K eggs as soon as possible for cooking a rice omelette. However she has been put in an\r\nuncomfortable situation. Someone has shuffled the eggs! Pompom knows the values Ai, however she\r\ndoesn't know which egg is which. She'd like to minimize the worst-case number of taps. What is the\r\nminimal number?InputThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line for\r\neach test case has 2 integers N and K. Then next line has N integers A1, A2 ... AN.OutputFor each test case, print the minimal number of taps for the worst-case.Constraints1 ≤ T ≤ 101 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 30001 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000ExampleInput:3\r\n2 1\r\n5 8\r\n2 1\r\n5 58\r\n3 2\r\n1 2 3Output:8\r\n10\r\n5ExplanationIn the first case, if a egg isn't broken after 5 taps, she should continue to tap the same egg.In the second case, if a egg isn't broken after 5 taps, she should tap another egg 5 times.",
