You complete me\", he replied.Being impressed by him, she gave him an another task.Build a tree with following rules:If a node with (l, r) is givenBreak it into left node with (l, mid)Break it into right node with (mid + 1, r)stop when leaf node appears (l = r)where mid=(l + r) / 2.So count the number of leaf nodes which do not appear in pairs.For more clarification, see examples below.InputLine 1: Number of queries (≤ 100000)Line 2: In next q lines, l r is given (0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018)OutputFor every query, print the answer.ExampleInput:2\r\n2 4\r\n4 5Output:1\r\n0Explanation : In (2, 4) → (2, 3) and (4, 4).\r\n                 (2, 3) → (2, 2) and (3, 3).\r\n              Here (4, 4) is the only leaf node which didn't appear in pair.",
