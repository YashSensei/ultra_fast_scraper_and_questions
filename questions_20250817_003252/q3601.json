  "text": "Little Gopu was playing with graphs. He encountered following problem while playing.Given a graph G with n vertices and m edges. Let us say it has k connected components. Find out how many numbers of ways you can add k - 1 edges to make the graph connected. Note that the new edge you are going to add should not be a repeated edge i.e. if you are going to connect u, v then there should not be an edge between u, v already in the graph. Output the answer modulo 109+ 7.If the graph is already connected, Output -1Help Gopu with this task.InputFirst line contains T : number of test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 20)For each test case, First line contains two space separated integers n, m: (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105).Then For each of the next m lines, each line contains two space separated integers u and v denoting that u and v are connected to each other. (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v)OutputFor each test case, output the answer as required.ExampleInput:44 21 23 45 31 23 44 53 31 22 33 17 51 23 44 53 56 7Output:46-184",
