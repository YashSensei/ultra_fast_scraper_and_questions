  "text": "In a galaxy far far away there is a new low-cost space carrier starting daily interplanetary flights. In the galaxy there areNplanets, numbered with integers from 1 toN. Cost of a flight between two planets depends only on take-off/landing fees of those planets. For each planetkyou are given his fee,pk, so the cost of a flight between planetsaandbispa+ pb.Space carrier wants to determine the flights it will offer daily so that any planet can be reached from any other planet, directly or indirectly.Because of space reasons it's possible to conduct flights only between certain pairs of planets. Allowed flights are described withMpermissions of form \"xkakbk\" which means it's possible to conduct a bidirectional flight between planetxkand any planetc, whereak≤c≤bk.Find the minimum total cost of offered flights such that all planets are connected.InputN Mp1p2.. pNx1a1b1x2a2b2..xMaMbM1 ≤ N, M ≤ 105For each pkfollowing holds: 0 ≤ pk≤ 106.For each permission it holds that either xk< akor xk> bk.Also, it's possible that some pairs of planets are listed in more than one permission.It will always be possible to choose flights such that all planets are connected.OutputMinimum daily cost of space carrier transportation system.ExampleInput:6 83 5 8 2 9 43 1 26 3 33 1 16 2 22 3 63 1 23 2 24 1 1Output:46Explanation: we connect following pairs of planets: (1, 3), (1, 4), (4, 2), (2, 5), (2, 6).",
