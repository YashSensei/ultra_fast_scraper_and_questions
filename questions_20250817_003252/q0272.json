  "text": "We wish to tile a grid 4 units high andNunits long with rectangles (dominoes) 2 units by one unit (in\r\neither orientation). For example, the figure shows the five different ways that a grid 4 units high and 2\r\nunits wide may be tiled.Write a program that takes as input the width,W, of the grid and outputs the number of different ways\r\nto tile a 4-by-Wgrid.InputThe first line of input contains a single integerN, (1 ≤N≤ 1000) which is the number of datasets that\r\nfollow.Each dataset contains a single decimal integer, the width,W, of the grid for this problem instance.OutputFor each problem instance, there is one line of output: The problem instance number as a decimal\r\ninteger (start counting at one), a single space and the number of tilings of a 4-by-Wgrid. The values\r\nofWwill be chosen so the count will fit in a 32-bit integer.ExampleInput:3\r\n2\r\n3\r\n7Output:1 5\r\n2 11\r\n3 781",
