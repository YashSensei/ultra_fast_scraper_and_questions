  "text": "Your task is to take anN-by-Nmatrix and pick numbers that can be added or subtracted from one another to most closely approximate 0. The catch is that you must only use exactly one number in each row and columnâ€”no more, no less.ExampleConsider the following matrix whereN= 3.1   75   10 \r\n   22  500    3\r\n    9  125   5075 - 22 - 50 = 3 is the correct answer. 10 - 1 - 9 = 0, but 1 and 9 are from the same column. 3 - 1 = 2, but does not use enough numbers.InputThe first line contains a single positive integerT, representing the number of test cases.Ttest cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing a single integerN, representing the size of the matrix. The nextNlines each containNspace-separated integers, representing the matrix.OutputFor each test case, output a single line containing the absolute value of the total found that is closest to 0.SampleInput2\r\n2\r\n1 5\r\n4 3\r\n3\r\n1 75 10\r\n22 500 3\r\n9 125 50Output1\r\n3",
