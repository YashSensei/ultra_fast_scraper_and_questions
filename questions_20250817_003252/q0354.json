  "text": "Atreeconsists of a node and some (zero, one or two) subtrees connected\r\nto it. These subtrees are called children.Aspecificationof the tree is a sequence of digits. If the number of\r\nchildren in the tree is:zero, then the specification is a sequence with only one element '0';one, the specification begins with '1' followed by the specification of the\r\n  child;two, the specification begins with '2' followed by the specification of the\r\n  first child, and then by the specification of the second child.Each of the vertices in the tree must be painted either red or green or blue.However, we need to obey the following rules:the vertex and its child cannot have the same color,if a vertex has two children, then they must have different colors.How many vertices may be painted green?TaskWrite a program which:reads the specification of the tree from the standard input,computes the maximal and the minimal number of vertices that may be painted\r\n  green,writes the results in the standard output.InputThe number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow in separate lines.\r\nEach test case consists of one word (no\r\nlonger then 10000 characters), which is a specification of a tree.OutputYour program should write for each test case \r\nexactly two integers separated by a single space, which respectively\r\ndenote the\r\nmaximal and the minimal number of vertices that may be painted green.ExampleSample input:1\r\n1122002010Sample output:5 2",
