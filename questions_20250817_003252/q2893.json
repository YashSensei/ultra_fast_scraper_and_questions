  "text": "You have given a matrix of size n×m. Every cell of matrix denote gcd of respective indices. For exampleA 3×2 matrix have entriesgcd(1,1)gcd(1,2)gcd(2,1)gcd(2,2)gcd(3,1)gcd(3,2)You have given queries i1 j1 i2 j2.You have to find the sum of matrix formed by upper left corner (i1, j1) and lower right corner (i2, j2).InputFirst line indicates number of test cases. (T<=500)Next line have space separated two integers n and m. (1<=n, m<=50000).Next T lines contains queries i1 j1 i2 j2.where i1<=i2, j1<=j2.OutputPrint answer modulo M for each query in new line. (M=10^9+7)ExampleInput:2\r\n3 2\r\n1 1 2 2\r\n2 1 3 2Output:5\r\n5",
