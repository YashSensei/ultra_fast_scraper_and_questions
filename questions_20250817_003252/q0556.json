Calculate the total area that these N circles cover.InputFirst line: N (1 ≤ n ≤ 50)- In the i-th line of the next n lines contains 3 integers Xi, Yi and Ri, separated by spaces. These are the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th circle (-10000 ≤ Yi-Ri, Yi+Ri, Xi-Ri, Xi+Ri ≤ 10000)OutputThe total area that these N circles cover with 5 digits after decimal pointExampleInput:2\r\n5 6 3\r\n5 5 5Output:78.53982",
