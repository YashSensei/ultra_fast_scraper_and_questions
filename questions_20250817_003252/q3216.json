  "text": "You have a piece of iron wire with length ofnunit. Now you decide to cut it into several ordered pieces and fold each piece into a triangle satisfying that all triangles areintegraland pairwisesimilar.count the number of different approaches to form triangles. Two approaches are considered different if they produce different numbers of triangles, and/or there existsithat thei-th (again, pieces are ordered) triangle in one approaches is notcongruenttoith triangle in another plan.Since the answer can be very large, output the answer modules 1000000007.Solve this problem by at most 0.5 KB of source code.InputEach test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤  5,000,000). Process until EOF is reached.OutputFor each test case, output one line.
