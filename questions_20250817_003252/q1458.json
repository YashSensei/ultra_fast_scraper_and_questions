Each contains a line with 10 integers with absolute value less than 1000 - the X and Y coordinates of the 5 points, respectively.Input terminates by EOF. Note that there can be extra spaces in a single line.OutputEach line contains a single float-point number - the area of the corresponding ellipse, or \"IMPOSSIBLE\" if the ellipse doesn't exist or can't be unique determined.ExampleInput:6 1 3 2 -2 -3 -3 -2 1 6\r\n7 -3 2 7 6 3 5 5 -2 -9Output:IMPOSSIBLE\r\n157.079633Note: You can click on \"Wrong Answer\" to get further information.Note: Judge is slightly modified to avoid some precision problems.",
