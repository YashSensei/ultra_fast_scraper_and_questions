Note that this problem has larger constraints.The task is: \"Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form (Reverse Polish Notation). Two-argument operators: +, -, *, /, ^ (priority from the lowest to the highest), brackets ( ). Operands: only letters: a,b,...,z. Assume that there is only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c).\"Inputt [the number of expressions ≤ 1000]expression[length = See: \"Other Info\" part][other expressions]OutputTheexpressionsin RPN form, one per line.ExampleInput:3\r\n(a+(b*c))\r\n((a+b)*(z+x))\r\n((a+t)*((b+(a+c))^(c+d)))Output:abc*+\r\nab+zx+*\r\nat+bac++cd+^*Other InfoInput: I deliberately not tell the input length, constraints, distribution, etc. You can guess it from judge output for my BF program (BF Cell Used) ;-) And of course I generate it randomly (But I can't tell the distribution).This problem is using a custom judge, so you can see the detail after you get AC/WA.The judge output format is like this: (\"Code Length (Valid Command only)\")\"Cell Used\"(\"BF Command executed\").Click here to see my submission result for this problem.I have two solutions for this problem:1) ID 9658441 (optimized): Judge output for my BF code is: (471)4320(606116310) meaning that my Valid BF commands = 471 commands and My code using 4320 BF cell and 606116310 commands executed.2) ID 9658572 (golfed): Judge output for my BF code is: (295)4320(888371635) meaning that my Valid BF commands = 295 commands and My code using 4320 BF cell and 888371635 commands executed.You can click (AC/WA) status for more detail.My code running time is 0.68s (optimized solution) and 1.47s (golfed solution) and both using 1.6M of memory.The time limit is ~14× my BF program top speed.See also:Another problem added by Tjandra Satria Gunawan",
