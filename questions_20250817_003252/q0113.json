  "text": "You're given a sequencesofNdistinct integers. Consider all the possible sums of three integers from the sequence at three different indices. For each obtainable sum output the number of different triples of indices that generate it.ConstraintsN ≤ 40000, |si| ≤ 20000InputThe first line of input contains a single integer N. Each of the next N lines contain an element of s.OutputPrint the solution for each possible sum in the following format:sum_value : number_of_triplesSmaller sum values should be printed first.ExampleInput:5-12305Output:1 : 12 : 14 : 25 : 16 : 17 : 28 : 110 : 1Explanation:4 can be obtained using triples (0, 1, 2) and (0, 3, 4).7 can be obtained using triples (0, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4).Note:a triple is considered the same as any of its permutations.",
