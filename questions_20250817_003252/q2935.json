  "text": "Coder Sanjayis now ready to put up his first problem in his favorite websiteSPOJ. As it is his first problem, he wanted it to be easy so that most of them could get anAC.The problem statement looks like this:F(x)is a function whose properties are as follows.F(x) = 0at x = 0.F(x) = 1at x = 1.F(x) = 2at x = 2.F(x) = 0if x is an odd prime.F(a*b) = F(a) + F(b), where a, b are two positive integers and sum of a and b is minimum.Your task is simple. You are to output the value ofF(x)for the given input integerx.InputThe only line of input contains a single integerx(0 < x < 100001).OutputOutput the value ofF(x).ExampleInput:4Output:4",
