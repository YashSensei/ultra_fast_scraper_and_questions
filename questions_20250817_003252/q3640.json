  "text": "Rancho is in love with Pihu. So on the Valentine’s Day they decided to spend time together at Assi Ghat, but Rancho, as we all know is very busy with his work, so he failed. It was now Pihu’s turn to go mad with anger. But there’s something which you can do.Rancho tells Pihu that he is a novice programmer and is generally busy in solving problems at SPOJ. So Pihu decides to check his algorithmic skills. She puts forward an array ofNintegers. She gives him a numberPand asks if he can find three (strictly three) integersAiAjAk(i ≠ j ≠ k)in the array, whose sum is equal to numberP, i.e.Ai+ Aj+ Ak= P.Now, sooner Rancho answers her query inYESorNO, sooner he gets a kiss.InputThe first line of input consists of an integerT, the number of test cases.The second line of input consists of an integerNdenoting the size of array.The third line consists ofNintegersA1, A2, A3... AN, separated by space.The fourth line consists of numberP.Constraints1 ≤T≤ 153 ≤N≤ 10001 ≤Ai≤ 109where 1 ≤ i ≤ N1 ≤P≤ 3×109OutputIf you find three numbersAi, Aj, Ak, (i ≠ j ≠ k)in the array such thatAi+ Aj+ Ak= P, print “YES” else print “NO” (quotes for clarification only).ExampleInput:1\r\n3\r\n1 2 3\r\n6OutputYESAfter helping Rancho, would you like to help Pihu?.
