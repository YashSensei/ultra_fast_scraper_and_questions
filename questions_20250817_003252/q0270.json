  "text": "Deep in the Amazon jungle, exceptionally tall trees grow that support a rich biosphere of figs and\r\njuniper bugs, which happen to be the culinary delight of brown monkeys.Reaching the canopy of these trees requires the monkeys to perform careful navigation through the\r\ntall tree’s fragile vine system. These vines operate like a see-saw: an unbalancing of weight at any\r\nvine junction would snap the vine from the tree, and the monkeys would plummet to the ground\r\nbelow. The monkeys have figured out that if they work together to keep the vines properly balanced,\r\nthey canallfeast on the figs and juniper bugs in the canopy of the trees.Avine junctionsupports exactly twosub-vines, each of which must contain the same number of\r\nmonkeys, or else the vine will break, leaving a pile of dead monkeys on the jungle ground. For\r\npurposes of this problem, avine junctionis denoted by a pair of matching square brackets [ ], which\r\nmay contain nested information about junctions further down itssub-vines. The nesting of vines will\r\ngo no further than25levels deep.You will write a program that calculates theminimumnumber of monkeys required to balance a\r\nparticular vine configuration. There isalwaysat least one monkey needed, and, multiple monkeys\r\nmay hang from the same vine.InputThe first line of input contains a single integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) which is the number of datasets that\r\nfollow.Each dataset consists of a single line of input containing a vine configuration consisting of a string of\r\n[ and ] characters as described above. The length of the string of [ and ] will be greater than or\r\nequal to zero, and less than or equal to 150.OutputFor each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset\r\nnumber as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, and the minimum number of monkeys\r\nrequired to reach the canopy successfully. Assume that all the hanging vines are reachable from the\r\njungle floor, and that all monkeys jump on the vines at the same time.ExampleInput:3\r\n[]\r\n\r\n[[][[]]]Output:1 2\r\n2 1\r\n3 8",
