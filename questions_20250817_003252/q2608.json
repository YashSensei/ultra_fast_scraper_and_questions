  "text": "There are N numbered boxes placed on a table, let Bi denote the ith box in the line. Write a program that finds the total number of ways to place N identical balls such that at most k balls are present in the boxes B1 .... Bk for 1 ≤ k ≤ N. Since the number can be quite large you are supposed to output the answer modulo 761238923.InputInput will contain multiple testcases, on each line N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) will be given. The last line contains 0 which should not be processed.OutputFor each testcase output exactly one line, the total number possible of ways modulo 761238923.ExampleInput:120Output:12",
