  "text": "You will be given an array A with N integers A[1…N]. You will also be given two integers P and K. You need to find a value X [ X can be any value from array A] for which this function will be maximized:Here ABS means Absolute Value. For example: ABS(-1) is 1, also ABS(1) means 1.Here MOD means Modulo Operation. W MOD Y will give you the remainder after dividing W by Y.And X is any value from the array A.But we don’t have interest in X, as there will be several X for which the value will be maximized. So we just want the maximum value. Can you find it for us as you are a great programmer on SPOJ?InputInput starts with an integerT (≤ 5), denoting the number of test cases.Each case starts with a line containing three integersN,P and K. Then the next line will be consisting of N integers.1 <= N <= 1000001 <= P <= 1001 <= K <= 10000000091 <= A[i] <= 2000OutputFor each case, print the case number and the maximum value for the above function with respect to array A.SampleInput2\r\n3 1 10\r\n3 1 2\r\n3 2 10\r\n3 1 2OutputCase 1: 3\r\nCase 2: 5N.B: Dataset is huge. Use faster IO like Scanf, Printf",
