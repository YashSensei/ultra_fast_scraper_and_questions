  "text": "You're given a sequence A of N non-negative integers. Answer Q queries, where each query consists of two integers: a, b. The answer is number of pairs of integers i and j that satisfy these three conditions:1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ Na ≤ j - i + 1 ≤ ball elements of A with indices from range [i, j] are mutually distinct. (indexing starts with 1)Constraints1 ≤ N ≤ 8×1051 ≤ Q ≤ 2×1050 ≤ A[k] ≤ 106, for every integer k between 1 and N, inclusive1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ NInputFirst line of input contains integer N. Second line contains N integers representing sequence A. Third line is integer Q, number of queries. Next Q lines have 2 integers, a and b.OutputIn the i-th line output the answer for i-th query.ExampleInput:51 2 3 4 511 1Output:5NOTE: IO is huge",
