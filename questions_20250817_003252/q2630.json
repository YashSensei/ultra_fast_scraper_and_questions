First the most respected bandit takes1coin, then the second respected takes2coins ... the least respected takeskcoins, then again the most respected takesk+1coins, and so on, until one of the bandits takes the remaining coins. Calculate how much gold each of the bandits gets.InputThe first line of the input contains numbert– the amount of tests. Thenttest descriptions follow. Each test consists of two integersnandk- the number of coins and bandits respectively.Constraints1 ≤t≤ 500106≤n≤ 10152 ≤k≤ 100OutputFor each test print the amounts of coins each bandit gets separated by spaces.ExampleInput:3\r\n1000000 2\r\n1234567 3\r\n123456789 4Output:499849 500151\r\n411602 411887 411078\r\n30869901 30858368 30862296 30866224",
