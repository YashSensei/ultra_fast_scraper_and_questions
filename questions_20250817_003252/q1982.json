  "text": "WarningHere is a harder version ofAmazing Factor Sequence.To make things clear, you'll need a O(n^0.5) method to solve this problem.\r\nYou'll need to be careful with container of C-like language,\r\nand/or you'll need to find some little optimizations with slower language.The factor sequenceWe define our factor sequence with:a[0] = a[1] = 0, andforn > 1, a[n] = a[n - 1] + sum({x | x < n and n % x = 0}).InputFirst line of input contains an integerT, the number of test cases.Each of the nextTlines contains\r\n a single integern.OutputFor each test case, printa[n]on a single line.ExampleInput:3\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5Output:2\r\n5\r\n6Constraints0 < T < 101\r\n0 < n < 12148001999Numbersnare uniform-randomly chosen.Nmaxwas carefully chosen ;-)\r\nTime limit is Ã—2.5 my python one (2.56s).
