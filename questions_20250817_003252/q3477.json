If there are several solutions print the lexicographically smallest one.The output should have natural numbers only.Inputn ≤ 50n numbers each ≤ 105.OutputThe lexicographically smallest set of numbers.ExampleInput:1\r\n2Output:1 1Input:3\r\n2 2 2Output:1 1 1Input:6\r\n2 2 2 3 3 3Output:1 1 1 2Input:1\r\n4Output:1 3Here 2 2 and 3 1 are also possible solutions but we have to print the lexicographically smallest one.",
