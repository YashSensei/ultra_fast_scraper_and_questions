  "text": "After taking a modern art class, Farmer John has become interested in finding geometric patterns in everything around his farm. He carefully plots the locations of his N cows (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000), each one occupying a distinct point in the 2D plane, and he wonders how many different lines of symmetry exist for this set of points. A line of symmetry, of course, is a line across which the points on both sides are mirror images of each-other. Please help FJ answer this most pressing geometric question.Input:Line 1: The single integer N.Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers representing the x and y coordinates of the ith cow (-10,000 ≤ x, y ≤ 10,000).Output:Line 1: The number of different lines of symmetry of the point set.SampleInput4\r\n0 0\r\n0 1\r\n1 0\r\n1 1Output4ExplanationThe four cows form the corners of a square. There are 4 lines of symmetry – one vertical, one horizontal, and two diagonal.",
