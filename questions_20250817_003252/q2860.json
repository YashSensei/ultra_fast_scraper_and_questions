  "text": "Ada the Ladybug is on a trip in Bugindia. There are many cities and some uni-directional roads connecting them. Ada is wondering about the shortest path, which begins in a city and ends in the same city. Since Ada likes short trips, she asked you to find the length of such path for each city in Bugindia.InputThe first line will contain0 < N ≤ 2000, the number of cities.ThenNlines follow, each containingNintegers0 ≤     Hij≤ 1. One means, that there is a road betweeniandj(zero means there isn't a road).OutputPrintNlines, the length of shortest path which begins in cityiand ends in cityi. If the path doesn't exist, print \"NO WAY\" instead.Example Input5\r\n0 1 1 1 1\r\n1 0 0 0 1\r\n0 0 1 1 0\r\n0 0 1 0 0\r\n0 0 0 1 0Example Output2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n2\r\nNO WAYExample Input5\r\n0 1 0 0 1\r\n0 0 1 0 0\r\n0 0 0 1 0\r\n0 0 0 0 1\r\n1 0 0 0 0Example Output2\r\n5\r\n5\r\n5\r\n2",
