  "text": "Asutosh is very passionate about numbers. he has found a new type of numbers and calls them 'truncky numbers'.He has challenged his friend Shantanu to find the sum of first n truncky numbers. As Shantanu is weak at programming, help him to complete his challenge.A truncky number is defined as:sum of digits in the number is of the form (5×k + 1) where k = number of digits.absolute difference between any two digits in the number is either 0 or 1.digits are in the non decreasing order.Inputthe first line contains T (number of test cases). Each test contains only one integer n.OutputPrint in single line sum of first n truncky numbers modulo 109+ 7.Each output in new line.ConstraintsT ≤ 30N ≤ 1017ExampleInput:1\r\n2Output:62",
