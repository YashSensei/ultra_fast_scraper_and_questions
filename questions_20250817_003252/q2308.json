  "text": "A cube free number is a number with no divisors that are a cube number (A cube number is a cube of a integer like 8 (2 × 2 × 2) , 27 (3 × 3 × 3) ). So cube free numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 etc (we will consider 1 as cube free). 8, 16, 24, 27, 32 etc are not cube free number. So the position of 1 among the cube free numbers is 1, position of 2 is 2, 3 is 3 and position of 10 is 9. Given a positive number you have to say if its a cube free number and if yes then tell its position among cube free numbers.InputFirst line of the test case will be the number of test case T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000) . Then T lines follows. On each line you will find a integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000).OutputFor each input line, print a line containing“Case I: ”, where I is the test case number. Then if it is not a cube free number then print“Not Cube Free”. Otherwise print its position among the cube free numbers.ExampleSample Input:10\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8\r\n9\r\n10Sample Output:Case 1: 1\r\nCase 2: 2\r\nCase 3: 3\r\nCase 4: 4\r\nCase 5: 5\r\nCase 6: 6\r\nCase 7: 7\r\nCase 8: Not Cube Free\r\nCase 9: 8\r\nCase 10: 9",
