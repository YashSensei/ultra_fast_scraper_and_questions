  "text": "Given a labeled complete k-ary tree, find the largest labeled common ancestor of two given nodes. In a complete k-ary tree, the node in the tree is labeled sequentially from the left most child to right most child, level by level. Largest labeled common ancestor of A and B is defined as the largest labeled node in the tree which has A and B as descendants. A node is a descendant of itself.Be careful with your finger, the source limit is 256 bytes.InputThe first line of input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) the number of cases. Each cases contains three integers K, A and B (2 ≤ K ≤ 100; 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 2,000,000,000).OutputFor each test case, output in a line the largest labeled common ancestor node.ExampleInput:4\r\n3 42 7\r\n2 2 6\r\n2 1 105\r\n4 10 13Output:2\r\n1\r\n1\r\n3Whitespace ExplanationIf there no input in any line, then the output for that line is a blank line :)) Sorry for inconvenience. >:)",
