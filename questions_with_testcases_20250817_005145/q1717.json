  "text": "Mirko has given up on the difficult coach job and switched to food tasting instead. Having skipped\r\nbreakfast like a professional connoisseur, he is visiting a Croatian cured meat festival. The most\r\nrenowned cook at the festival, Marijan Bajs, has prepared N equal sausages which need to be\r\ndistributed to M tasters such that each taster gets a precisely equal amount. He will use his trusted knife\r\nto cut them into pieces.In order to elegantly divide the sausages, the number of cuts splitting individual sausages must be as\r\nsmall as possible. For instance, if there are two sausages and six tasters (the first test case below), it is\r\nsufficient to split each sausage into three equal parts, making a total of four cuts. On the other hand, if\r\nthere are three sausages and four tasters (the second test case below), one possibility is cutting off three\r\nquarters of each sausage. Those larger parts will each go to one of the tasters, while the fourth taster\r\nwill get the three smaller pieces (quarters) left over.Mirko wants to try the famous sausages, so he volunteered to help Bajs. Help them calculate the\r\nminimum total number of cuts needed to carry out the desired division.InputThe first and only line of input contains two positive integers, N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100), the number\r\nof sausages and tasters, respectively.OutputThe first and only line of output must contain the required minimum number of cuts.ExampleInput:2 6Output:4Input:3 4Output:3Input:6 2Output:0",
