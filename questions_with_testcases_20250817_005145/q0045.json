  "text": "Weird Wally's Wireless Widgets, Inc. manufactures an eclectic assortment\r\nof small, wireless, network capable devices, ranging from dog collars,\r\nto pencils, to fishing\r\nbobbers. All these devices have very small memories.\r\nEncryption algorithms like Rijndael, the candidate for the Advanced\r\nEncryption Standard (AES) are demonstrably secure but they don't fit \r\nin such a tiny memory. In order to provide some security for \r\ntransmissions to and from the devices, WWWW uses the following algorithm,\r\nwhich you are to implement.Encrypting a message requires three integer keys,k1,k2, andk3. The letters [a-i] form\r\none group, [j-r] a second group, and everything else ([s-z] and underscore) the\r\nthird group. Within each group the letters are rotatedleftbykipositions in the message.\r\nEach group is rotated independently\r\nof the other two.  Decrypting the message means doing\r\narightrotation \r\nbykipositions within each group.Consider \r\nthe messagethe_quick_brown_foxencrypted withkivalues of 2, 3 and 1. The\r\nencrypted string is_icuo_bfnwhoq_kxert. \r\nThe figure below shows the decrypting right rotations for one\r\ncharacter in each of the three character groups.Looking at all the letters in the group [a-i] we see\r\n{i,c,b,f,h,e} \r\nappear at positions {2,3,7,8,11,17} within the encrypted message.\r\nAfter a right rotation ofk1=2, these positions contain the\r\nletters {h,e,i,c,b,f}.\r\nThe table below shows the intermediate strings that come from doing\r\nall the rotations in the first group, then all rotations in the second group,\r\nthen all the rotations in the third group. Rotating letters in one group will\r\nnot change any letters in any of the other groups.[a-i],k1= 2[j-r],k2= 3[s-z] and _,k3= 1Encrypted:_icuo_bfnwhoq_kxert_heuo_icnwboq_kxfrt_heuq_ickwbro_nxfotDecrypted:_heuo_icnwboq_kxfrt_heuq_ickwbro_nxfotthe_quick_brown_foxChanges:^^   ^^  ^     ^^   ^  ^^ ^  ^^  ^ ^   ^   ^ ^  ^All input strings contain only lowercase letters and underscores(_).\r\nEach string\r\nwill be at most 80 characters long.
