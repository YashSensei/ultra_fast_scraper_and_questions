  "text": "Mirko has a herd of sheep, surrounded by fences backyard. While he was asleep, wolves have sneaked into the fenced area and attacked the sheep.Backyard is of a rectangular shape, and consists of fields arranged in rows and columns.Character '.' (full stop) represents a blank field.Character '#' represents a fence.Character 'k' represents a sheep.Character 'v' represents a wolf.Two fields belong to the same sector if we can move from the fieldAto the fieldBwithout going over the fence, by making onlyhorizontalandverticalsteps (we cannot move diagonally).If we can escape from field A from the backyard, that field does not belong to any sector.Luckily, Mirko taught his sheep Kung-Fu skills, andthey can defend themselves against wolves only if they outnumber the wolves in that sector. When there are more sheep in the sector than wolves, all wolves die without sheep casualties. Otherwise all sheep perish and wolves are unharmed. If a field doesn't belong in any sector, sheep will flee and wolfs will be left without a prey, so every animal survives.Write a program that will determine how many sheep and wolves will survive this bloody night.InputIntegers N and M, number of rows and columns which represent Mirko's backyard.In every of the N lines, there are M characters representing the appearance of Mirko's backyard - positions of the fences, wolves and sheep.Constraints3 ≤ N, M ≤ 250OutputIn the first and the only line, print the number ofsheepandwolvesthat will survive.ExampleInput:8 8.######.#..k...##.####.##.#v.#.##.#.k#k##k.##..##.v..v.#.######.Output:3 1",
