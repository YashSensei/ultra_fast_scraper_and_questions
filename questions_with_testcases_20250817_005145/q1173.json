  "text": "You are creating a new social network for dogs. Wow. The dogs don't have many possibilities for interacting with your website, but they can bark how many friends they want. E.g. if a dog wants to have much 8 friends it will bark 8 times, and if it doesn't want any friends, it'll just stay quiet.After spending a good year of your life collecting these barks, you are finally ready to assign a friend list for each dog. The only problem is: You are not sure whether it is actually possible. Thus before you proceed you would like to write a program, that given a list ofNwisheswi, outputsHAPPYif it is possible to make a friend list for each dogiof lengthwi, orSADif some dog will have to get more or fewer friends than it wished for.Notice: Being friends is considered a reflexive relation.InputThe first line will contain a single integerT- the number of test cases to process.Because of I/O constraints, the sequence of wishes is not given explicitly. Each of theTlines will consist of 5 integersN,a,b,c,min the range[0, 107](exceptmwhich is in[1, 107]). These integers describe the sequencex0= 0xi+1= (a*xi+ b) % mThe sequence of wishes iswi=xi+c.OutputWrite the answer -HAPPYorSAD- for each test case on a separate line.ExampleInput:3\r\n3 2 1 0 2\r\n5 1 1 0 5\r\n6 1 1 1 3Output:HAPPYSADHAPPYExplanationIn the first case we get the wishes \"0 1 1\", and we Â can make dog 2 and 3 be friends.In the second case we get the wishes \"0 1 2 3 4\". No assignment that works, since dog 5 would have to be friends with everyone, but dog 1 doesn't want that.In the third case we get the wishes \"1 2 3 1 2 3\".",
