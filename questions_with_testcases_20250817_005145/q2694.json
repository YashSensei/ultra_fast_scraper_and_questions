  "text": "Askar is planning to steal some gold from the golden river of Slovakistan! The river forms at (0,0) and flows in the north east direction - the liney = x.The river is well protected by the king's army, which is sure to give chase after him. As such, he came up with an ingenious plan - he will fly a helicopter, zig-zagging in order to shake off any pursuers. Askar will start at (0,0) and flydxmeters east, thendymeters north, thendxmeters east, thendymeters north, ... forever.Of course, he will only have a small window of opportunity to extract some gold from the river every time he crosses (or touches) it. He has yet to decide the exact values ofdxanddy- some might give him better chances at a successful escape, others will allow him to grab more loot.Help Askar and tell him how much he can get away with for each plan.InputThe first line contains an integer1 ≤ T ≤ 1000- the number of plans.Tlines follow, each containing two integers1 ≤ dx,dy≤ 1015.OutputOutput a single integer - the number of times Askar would cross the golden river.If Askar crosses the river an infinite number of times, output-1instead.ExampleInput:21 13 2Output:-11",
