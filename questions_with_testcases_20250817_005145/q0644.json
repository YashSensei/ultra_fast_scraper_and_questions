  "text": "There arexvillages in Andhere Nagar. Each village has its index — an integer number from 1 tox. The capital has index a. All the roads in Andhere Nagar are two-way. The road system is such that there is exactly one path from the capital to each city, i.e. the road map looks like a tree. In Andhere Nagar's chronicles the road map is kept in the following way: for each villagei, different from the capital, there is kept numberpi— index of the last village on the way from the capital toi.Once the king of Andhere Nagar, Choupat Raja, decided to move the capital from village a to village b. Naturally, after this the old representation of the road map in Andhere Nagar 's chronicles became incorrect. Please, help the king find out a new representation of the road map in the way described above.InputThe first line contains three space-separated integersx, a, b (2 ≤x≤ 5·104, 1 ≤ a ≠ b ≤n) — amount of villages in Andhere Nagar, index of the old capital and index of the new one, correspondingly.The following line containsx- 1 space-separated integers — the old representation of the road map. For each city, apart from a, there is given integerpi— index of the last city on the way from the capital to cityi. All the cities are described in order of increasing indexes.OutputOutputx- 1 numbers — new representation of the road map in the same format.Example 1Input:3 2 3\r\n2 2Output:2 3Example 2Input:6 2 4\r\n6 1 2 4 2Output:6 4 1 4 2",
