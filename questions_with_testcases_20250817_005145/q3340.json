  "text": "The Tyrell corporation uses a state-of-the-art electronic document system\r\n   that controls all aspects of document creation, viewing, editing, and\r\n   distribution. Document security is handled viaaccess control\r\n   lists(ACLs). An ACL defines a set of entities that have access to the\r\n   document, and for each entity defines the set of rights that it has.\r\n   Entities are denoted by uppercase letters; an entity might be a single\r\n   individual or an entire division. Rights are denoted by lowercase letters;\r\n   examples of rights areaforappend,dfordelete,eforedit, andrforread.The ACL for a document is stored along with that document, but there is\r\n   also a separate ACLlogstored on a separate log server. All\r\n   documents start with an empty ACL, which grants no rights to anyone. Every\r\n   time the ACL for a document is changed, a new entry is written to the log.\r\n   An entry is of the formExR, whereEis a nonempty set of\r\n   entities,Ris a nonempty set of rights, andxis either \"+\",\r\n   \"–\", or \"=\". EntryE+Rsays to grant all the rights\r\n   inRto all the entities inE, entryE–Rsays to remove all the rights inRfrom\r\n   all the entities inE, and entryE=Rsays that all the\r\n   entities inEhave exactly the rights inRand no others. An\r\n   entry might be redundant in the sense that it grants an entity a right it\r\n   already has and/or denies an entity a right that it doesn't have. A log is\r\n   simply a list of entries separated by commas, ordered chronologically from\r\n   oldest to most recent. Entries are cumulative, with newer entries taking\r\n   precedence over older entries if there is a conflict.Periodically the Tyrell corporation will run a security check by using\r\n   the logs to compute the current ACL for each document and then comparing it\r\n   with the ACL actually stored with the document. A mismatch indicates a\r\n   security breach. Your job is to write a program that, given an ACL log,\r\n   computes the current ACL.InputThe input consists of one or more ACL logs, each\r\n   3–79 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line\r\n   containing only \"#\" that signals the end of the input. Logs will be in the\r\n   format defined above and will not contain any whitespace.OutputFor each log, output a single line containing the log\r\n   number (logs are numbered sequentially starting with one), then a colon,\r\n   then the current ACL in the format shown below. Note that (1) spaces do not\r\n   appear in the output; (2) entities are listed in alphabetical order; (3) the\r\n   rights for an entity are listed in alphabetical order; (4) entities with no\r\n   current rights are not listed (even if they appeared in a log entry), so\r\n   it's possible that an ACL will be empty; and (5) if two or more consecutive\r\n   entities have exactly the same rights, those rights are only output once,\r\n   after the list of entities.ExampleInput:MC-p,SC+c\r\nYB=rde,B-dq,AYM+e\r\nGQ+tju,GH-ju,AQ-z,Q=t,QG-t\r\nJBL=fwa,H+wf,LD-fz,BJ-a,P=aw\r\n#Output:1:CSc\r\n2:AeBerMeYder\r\n3:\r\n4:BHJfwLPaw",
