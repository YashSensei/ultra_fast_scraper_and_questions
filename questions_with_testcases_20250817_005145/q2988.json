  "text": "Rainbow 6 is a very popular game in colleges. There are 2 teams, each having some members and the 2 teams play some matches against each other. The team which wins the maximum number of matches wins the game! Two of my friends Ashank and Aditya (better known as Harbinger and Sciencepal) are great gamers and they want to compete. So they decide to form their own teams.There are 2×N players who are interested to be a part of their team. Each player has some rating (based on his performance) and Akarsh (Nimbus) is responsible for forming their teams. Being a good friend of both, he wants to form two teams such that the difference of total ratings of the players between the teams becomes minimum. The players come to him in pairs and he has to put one of them in Harbinger's team and the other in Sciencepal's team at that instant. This is a tedious task for him and therefore he needs your help!InputThe first line of the input contains an integerTdenoting the number of the test cases. (1 ≤ T ≤ 10)First line of each test case contains a numberNdenoting the number of pair of players. (1 ≤ N ≤ 200)NextNlines contains rating of the persons in pairs asxandy. (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2500)OutputFor each test case, print a single integer denoting the minimum possible absolute rating difference between Sciencepal's and Harbinger's team.ExampleInput:122 34 5Output:0",
