  "text": "Doctor Jones is a famous archeologist. He did some research on the Tiribaki Islands recently. His most famous discovery was the Meteoronome - a machine with a yellow button used by the Tiribakian highest priest to predict the weather. The Meteoronome had been set up by the gods at the Beginning of Time. Tiribakians pressed the button every day. As a result, the Meteoronome produced a number - the expected rainfall in millimetres for the next day. More precisely, afteributton hits (counted since the Beginning of Time) Meteoronome gives the expected rainfall for the dayisince the Beginning of Time.Unfortunately, the Meteoronome has not been used for several thousands of years and nobody knows how many steps should be performed to reach the current date. Researchers have spent a lot of effort to find out how the Meteoronome works. A mathematical model has been proposed: The Meteoronome is initialized by a pair of integers, s[0] and t[0]. For thei-th step, the Meteoronome computes the valuess[i] = (78901 + 31*s[i-1]) mod  699037\r\nt[i] = (23456 + 64*t[i-1]) mod 2097151The output of the i-th step is the numbera[i]=(s[i] mod 100 + 1) * (t[i] mod 100 + 1)Doctor Jones's friend, Ms. Linda Watson, is now planning a holiday on Tiribaki Islands. She would like to stay there as long as possible but she hates the rain. She can stand no more than M millimetres of rainfall during her entire stay on Tiribaki.Doctor Jones wants to help his friend and to compute the longest period which she can safely stay on Tiribaki. He simulatedNsteps of the Meteoronome. This way, he obtained a sequence of numbers a[1], a[2] ... a[N] which represent predictions forNsubsequent days. Now he wants to find the largestKsuch that for each period of at mostKsubsequent days from dayito dayjthe sum of the predictions a[i]+a[i+1]+...+a[j] is less than or equal toM. Linda can be sure that if she stays on Tiribaki for at mostKdays, she can endure the rain (provided thatNis large enough).Input specificationThe input file consists of several blocks of data. The first line of the input file contains the number of blocks. Each block contains four integers delimited by whitespace: s[0], t[0] - the initial values for the Meteoronome,N(1<=N<=1500000)- the length of the sequence andM- the maximum sum of a subsequence. All the input data fits into 32-bit signed integer.Output specificationThe output file contains one line for each block of input data. In this line there is a single integerKas specified above.ExampleInput file:1\r\n123456 123456 10 10000Output file:2Note, that the sequence produced by Meteoronome for this input file is 4664, 1248, 267, 4900, 837, 4048, 990, 6935, 1155, 490. No subsequence of length 2 has sum greater than 10000 and there are subsequences of length 3 with greater sum.",
