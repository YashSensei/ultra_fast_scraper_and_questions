  "text": "Little Aron has to visit the planets of one system. Imagine that the planets are ordered in line and labeled with the numbers1ton.Aron hasn - 1teleports labeled with1, 2 ... n - 1. The teleport labeled withtcould transmit only once, one human from a planet labeled withmto the planets with labelm + torm - t, if such planet exists. Using a space-stop Aron could go to the planet labeled withk, i.e. he starts his journey from a planet with a labelk. For the givennandkyou have to find the best way Aron can use the teleports in order to visit as many different planets of the system, as possible.InputFirst line contains two integersnandk(1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000).OutputOutput should contain indicest, of the teleports that Aron used, in the order in which he used them. Moreover you have to outputtif he used the teleport to jump from a planet with the smaller number to a planet with a higher, and-tif he jumped from a planet with a higher number to a planet with a smaller number.If there are several solutions with the same number of teleports, you can output any one of them.ExampleInput:6 2Output:4 -5 3 -1 2NOTE - A simpler version of this task appeared on ITI 2012, Shumen.",
