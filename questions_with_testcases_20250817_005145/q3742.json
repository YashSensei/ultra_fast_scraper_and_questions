  "text": "Barney Stinson ;) is way too flirty. He has many girlfriends and he wants to keep all of them happy. He hasMgirlfriends. He boughtNgifts for them. Now he knows that some girlfriends need more gifts and some need less. So he decided that he will give at leastAigifts and at mostBigifts to hisith girlfriend. He has to give away all theNgifts. Tell us in how many different ways he can do this.InputFor each test case, first line contains two integersMandN,then follows M lines each having two integersAiandBi(1 ≤ i ≤ M). Input ends with M and N both equal to 0 and that case should not be processed.Output:For each test case, output the number of different ways in which he can distribute those gifts in a single line.Constraints1 ≤ M ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 0 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤100ExampleInput:3 5\r\n0 1\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n0 0Output:6ExplanationHe can distribute 5 gifts in his 3 girlfriends in 6 different ways as follows (0 1 4), (0 2 3), (0 3 2), (1 1 3), (1 2 2), (1 3 1).",
