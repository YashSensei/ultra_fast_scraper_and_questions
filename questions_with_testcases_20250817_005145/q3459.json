  "title": "Tough Water Level",
  "tags": [],
  "text": "Czech Technical University has the word \"technical\" in its name. Beside others, this means\r\nthat lectures in physics are important here. Do you still remember some of the basic physical\r\nprinciples.For example, imagine a simple glass of water. Or, we will rather call it a cup to avoid ambiguity of this word. So, imagine a simple cup (made of glass) that is partially filled with water. You\r\nmight have noticed that the stability of such a cup depends on the amount of water inside. If\r\nyou brush against a full cup, it is relatively easy to knock it down and spill its contents. If the\r\ncup is empty, there is fortunately nothing to be spilled, but other than that, the situation does\r\nnot improve much - it is still easy to knock the cup down with only a little force. The best\r\nstability is usually achieved with a \"half-full\" cup.In this problem, your task is to determine the water level that makes a cup as much stable as\r\npossible. For the purpose of this problem, we will make a simple assumption that the \"stability\"\r\nof a cup is higher, if its center of mass (sometimes also called the center of gravity) is lower\r\n(closer to the bottom).The center of mass can be informally defined as follows: Imagine that glass and water consist of\r\na very large number of very small particles. Then the center of mass is an average of the position\r\nof all these particles. The average is weighted by particle masses. Since the density of glass is\r\napproximately 2 500 kg.m-3 and the density of water only 1 000 kg.m-3, we will suppose that\r\nthe mass of a glass particle is 2.5 times higher than the mass of a water particle of the same\r\nsize.All cups considered in this problem will have an exact rotary shape. But their radius may vary\r\nwith the height - some cups are wider at the top, others are wider at the bottom. Also, the\r\nthickness of the glass may not be constant.The left figure shows a typical cup considered in this problem. It can be fully described by its\r\nheight (H), thickness of the bottom (B), and two functions R and T . Both of these functions\r\ntake a current height as their argument and they give the outer radius (R) and glass thickness (T )\r\nin the appropriate height. Please note that the thickness is always measured strictly horizontally\r\nand may therefore not reflect the \"real thickness\" of the glass in its usual meaning.InputThe input contains several cup descriptions. Each description consists of three lines. The first\r\nline contains two numbers: H (cup height) and B (bottom thickness), 0 < B < H <= 100.\r\nThe second line contains an expression R(x) (radius), the third line an expression T (x) (glass\r\nthickness). All data are given in centimeters. The last description is followed by a line with two\r\nzeros.The expressions will contain only digits (\"0\" through \"9\"), decimal points (\".\"), four basic\r\noperators (\"+\", \"-\", \"*\", and \"/\"), parentheses (\"(\"and\")\"), and the lowercase letters \"x\"\r\ndenoting the input variable (height measured from the cup bottom).Vx, 0 <= x <= H, the radius will satisfy: 0.1 < R(x) <= 100Vx, B <= x <= H, the thickness will satisfy: 0.1 <= T (x) < R(x)Arithmetical operators have their usual meaning and priorities, i.e., multiplication and division have a higher priority than addition and subtraction.OutputFor each cup, output the sentence \"Pour L litres / W cm of water.\", where L is the\r\namount of water that must be poured into the cup to reach the maximal stability (in litres). W\r\nis the water level (in centimeters) measured from the bottom of the cup. Both numbers must\r\nbe given with exactly three decimal digits.ExampleInput9 1\r\n3+x/6\r\n17/8-x/8\r\n10 1\r\n(x+10)\r\n10/(x+10)\r\n0 0OutputPour 0.030 litres / 3.365 cm of water.\r\nPour 0.878 litres / 2.193 cm of water.",
