  "text": "You are on your way to your first job interview as a program tester, and you are already late. The interview is in a skyscraper and you are currently in  floors, where you see an elevator. Upon entering the elevator, you learn that it has only two buttons, marked \"UPu\" and \"DOWNd\". You conclude that the UP-button takes the elevatorufloors up (if there aren't enough floors, pressing the UP-button does nothing, or at least so you assume), whereas the DOWN-button takes youdstories down (or none if there aren't enough). Knowing that the interview is at floorg, and that there are onlyffloors in the building, you quickly decide to write a program that gives you the amount of button pushes you need to perform. If you simply cannot reach the correct  floor, your program halts with the message \"use the stairs\".Given inputf,s,g,uandd(floors, start, goal, up, down), find the shortest sequence of button presses you must press in order to get fromstog, given a building of floors, or output \"use the stairs\" if you cannot get fromstogby the given elevator.InputThe input will consist of one line, namelyf s g u d, where 1 <= s, g <= f <= 1000000 and 0 <= u, d <= 1000000. The  floors are one-indexed, i.e. if there are 10 stories, s and g be in [1; 10].OutputYou must reply with the minimum numbers of pushes you must make in order to get from s to g, or output \"use the stairs\" if it is impossible given the conguration of the elevator.ExampleInput:10 1 10 2 1Output:6Input:100 2 1 1 0Output:use the stairs",
